<p>vr late, too late borne, or too soone
<i>dying Prince, <span class="smcap">Henry</span> of famous memorie,
your deceased brother, sent for
mee, a few monethes before his death.
And at my second comming to his presence,
among some other speeches, hee
complained much of our Histories of <span class="f">England</span>; and that the <span class="f">English</span> Nation,
which is inferiour to none in Honourable actions, should be
surpassed by all, in leauing the memorie of them to posteritie. For
this cause hee blamed the negligence of former ages: as if they
were ignorant of their owne deseruings, as if they esteemed themselues
vnworthie of their worth.</i></p>

<p><i>I answered, that I conceiued these causes hereof; One, that
men of sufficiencie were otherwise employed; either in publicke
affaires, or in wrestling with the world, for maintenance or encrease
of their priuate estates. Another is, for that men might
safely write of others in a tale, but in maner of a History,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
safely they could not: because, albeit they should write of men
long since dead, and whose posteritie is cleane worne out; yet some
aliue, finding themselues foule in those vices, which they see obserued,
reproued, condemned in others; their guiltinesse maketh
them apt to conceiue, that whatsoeuer the words are, the finger
pointeth onely at them. The last is, for that the Argument of our
<span class="f">English</span> historie hath bene so soiled heretofore by some vnworthie
writers, that men of qualitie may esteeme themselues discredited
by dealing in it.</i></p>

<p><i>And is not this (said he) an errour in vs, to permit euery man
to be a writer of Historie? Is it not an errour to be so curious in
other matters, and so carelesse in this? We make choise of the most
skilfull workemen to draw or carue the portraiture of our faces,
and shall euery artlesse Pensell delineate the disposition of our
minds? Our apparell must be wrought by the best Artificers, and
no soile must be suffered to fall vpon it: and shall our actions, shall
our conditions be described by euery bungling hand? Shall euery
filthie finger defile our reputation? Shall our Honour be basely
buried in the drosse of rude and absurd writings? Wee are carefull
to prouide costly Sepulchers, to preserue our dead liues, to preserue
some memorie what wee haue bene: but there is no monument,
either so durable, or so largely extending, or so liuely and
faire, as that which is framed by a fortunate penne; the memory
of the greatest Monuments had long since perished, had it not
bene preserued by this meanes.</i></p>

<p><i>To this I added; that I did alwayes conceiue, that we should
make our reckoning of three sorts of life: the short life of nature,
the long life of fame, and the eternall life of glorie. The life of
glorie is so farre esteemed before the other two, as grace is predominant
in vs: the life of fame before our naturall life is so farre
esteemed, as a generous spirit surmounteth sensualitie; as humane
nature ouerruleth brutish disposition. So farre as the noble nature
of man hath dominion in our minds, so farre do we contemne,
either the inc&#333;modities, or dangers, or life of our body, in regard
of our reputation and fame. Now seeing this life of fame is both
preserued and enlarged chiefly by history; there is no man (I suppose)
that will either resist, or not assist, the commendable or at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
least tolerable writing thereof, but such as are conscious to themselues,
either that no good, or that nothing but ill, can bee reported
of them. In whom notwithstanding it is an errour to thinke,
that any power of the present time, can either extinguish or obscure
the memorie of times succeeding. Posteritie will giue to euery
man his due: Some ages hereafter will affoord those, who
will report vnpartially of all.</i></p>

<p><i>Then he questioned whether I had wrote any part of our <span class="f">English</span>
Historie, other then that which had been published; which
at that time he had in his hands. I answered, that I had wrote
of certaine of our <span class="f">English</span> Kings, by way of a briefe description
of their liues: but for historie, I did principally bend, and binde
my selfe to the times wherein I should liue; in which my owne
obseruations might somewhat direct me: but as well in the one as
in the other I had at that time perfected nothing.</i></p>

<p><i>To this he said; that in regard of the honour of the time, hee
liked well of the last; but for his owne instruction, he more desired
the first: that he desired nothing more then to know the actions
of his Auncestours; because hee did so farre esteeme his descent
from them, as he approached neere them in honourable endeauours.
Hereupon, beautifying his face with a sober smile, he
desired mee, that against his returne from the progresse then
at hand, I would perfect somewhat of both sorts for him, which
he promised amply to requite; and was well knowen to be one who
esteemed his word aboue ordinary respects. This stirred in mee,
not onely a will, but power to perfourme; so as engaging my duety
farre aboue the measure either of my leisure or of my strength,
I finished the liues of these three Kings of <span class="f">Norman</span> race, and certaine
yeeres of Queene <span class="smcap">Elizabeths</span> Reigne.</i></p>

<p><i>At his returne from the Progresse to his house at <span class="f">S. Iames</span>,
these pieces were deliuered vnto him; which hee did not onely
courteously, but ioyfully accept. And because this seemed a perfect
worke, he expressed a desire that it should be published. Not
long after he died; and with him died both my endeauours and
my hopes. His death, alasse! hath bound the liues of many vnto
death, face to face; being no wayes able, either by forgetfulnesse
to couer their griefe, or to diminish it with consideration.</i></p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span></p>

<p><i>For in trueth he was a Prince of a most Heroical heart: Free
from many vices which sometimes accompanie high estates, full
of most amiable and admirable vertues: of whose perfections the
world was not worthy. His eyes were full of pleasant modestie;
his countenance manly beautifull; in bodie both strongly and delicately
made; in behauiour sweetely sober, which gaue grace to
whatsoeuer he did. He was of a discerning wit; and for the facultie
of his mind, of great capacitie and power, accompanied with
equall expedition of will: much foreseeing in his actions, and for
passions a commander of himselfe; and of good strength to resist
the power of prosperitie. In counsaile he was ripe and measured,
in resolution constant, his word euer led by his thought, and followed
by his deede. And albeit hee was but yong and his nature
forward and free, yet his wisedome reduced both to a true
temper of moderation; his desires being neuer aboue his reason,
nor his hopes inferiour to his desires. In a word, hee was the most
faire fruit of his Progenitours, an excellent ornament of the present
age, a true mirrour to posteritie: being so equally both setled
to valour, and disposed to goodnesse and Iustice, as hee expressed
not onely tokens, but proofes, both of a courage, and of a grauitie
and industrie right worthie of his estate.</i></p>

<p><i>Glorious Prince, my loue and duety hath caried me further,
then happily is fit for the present purpose: and yet this is but an
earnest onely of my earnest affection and zeale to thy Honour.
I shall hereafter haue a more proper place to display at large,
the goodlinesse of thy shape, the goodnesse of thy nature, the
greatnesse of thy minde: all thy <span class="f">perfections</span>, whereby our <span class="f">affections</span>
were much enflamed. And euillworthy may he be of any
happy hopes, who will not adde one blast of his breath, to make vp
the glorious gale of thy fame.</i></p>

<p><i>In the meane time I haue here accomplished his desire in publishing
this worke: More to testifie to the world the height of his
heart, then for any pleasure I haue to set foorth any thing, to the
view of these both captious and vnthankefull times; wherein
men will be, not readers onely, but interpreters, but wresters, but
corrupters and deprauers of that which they reade; wherein men
thinke the reproofe of others, to be the greatest parcell of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
owne praise. But how should I expect any better vsage? The
Commentaries of <span class="f">Cæsar</span>, neuer disliked before, are esteemed by
<span class="f">Lypsius</span>, a dry saplesse piece of writing. The most famous <span class="f">Tacitus</span>
is tearmed by <span class="f">Alceate</span>, <a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a><span class="f">a thicket of thornes</span>; by <span class="f">Budæus</span>, <a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
<span class="f">a most lewd Writer</span>; by <span class="f">Tertullian</span>, <a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a><span class="f">an exceeding
lyar</span>; by <span class="f">Orosius</span>, <a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a><span class="f">a flatterer</span>; then which assuredly he is nothing
lesse. I will not expect any better vsage, I will not desire it;
I will hereafter esteeme nothing of any worth, which hath not
many to detract from it.</i></p>

<p><i>Whatsoeuer this is, I haue presumed to present it to your
Highnesse, for these causes following: First, for that it receiued
this being from him, who was most dearely esteemed by you;
who may be iustly proposed, as an example of vertue, as a guide
to glory and fame. Secondly, for that the persons of whom it
treateth, are those most worthy Ancestors of yours, who laid the
foundation of this English Empire; who were eminent among
all the Princes of their times, and happely for many ages after, as
well in actions of Peace as of Warre. Lastly, for that I esteeme
Histories the fittest subiect for your Highnesse reading: For by
diligent perusing the actes of great men, by considering all the
circumstances of them, by comparing Counsailes and meanes
with euents; a man may seeme to haue liued in all ages, to haue
beene present at all enterprises; to be more strongly confirmed in
Iudgement, to haue attained a greater experience, then the longest
life can possibly affoord.</i></p>

<p><i>But because many errours doe vsually arise, by ignorance of
the State wherein we liue; because it is dangerous to frame rules
of Policie out of Countreys differing from vs, both in nature,
and custome of life, and forme of gouernment; no Histories are
so profitable as our owne. In these your Highnesse may see, the
noble disposition and delights of your Ancestors; what were their
sweete walkes, what their pleasant Chases: how farre they preferred
glory, before either pleasure or safetie; how by the braue
behauiour of their sword, they hewed honour out of the sides of
their enemies. In these you may see, the largenesse, commodities,
and strength of this Countrey; the nature of the people,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
their wealth, pleasure, exercise and trade of life, and what else
is worthy of obseruation. Generally, by these you may so furnish
your selfe, as not easily to be abused either by weake or deceitfull
aduise.</i></p>

<p><i>The Most <span class="f">High</span> preserue and prosper your <span class="f">Highnesse</span>: that
as you <span class="f">succeed</span> many excellent Ancestours in blood, so you may
exceed them all in Honourable atchieuements.</i></p>

<p>obert Duke of
<i>Normandie</i>, the sixth in descent
fr&#333; <i>Rollo</i>, riding through
<i>Falais</i> a towne in <i>Normandie</i>,
espied certaine yong persons
dauncing neere the way. And as he stayed to
view a while the maner of their disport, he fixed
his eye especially vpon a certaine damosell
named <i>Arlotte</i>; of meane birth, a Skinners
daughter, who there daunced among the rest.
The frame and comely carriage of her body,
the naturall beautie and graces of her countenance,
the simplicitie of her rurall both behauiour
and attire pleased him so well, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
same night he procured her to be brought to
his lodging; where he begate of her a sonne,
who afterward was named <i>William</i>.</p>

<p>I will not defile my writing with memory of
some lasciuious behauiour which she is reported
to haue vsed, at such time as the Duke approched
to embrace her. And doubtfull it is,
whether vpon some speciall note of immodestie
in herselfe, or whether vpon hate towards
her sonne, the English afterwards adding an
aspiration to her name (according to the naturall
maner of their pronouncing) termed euery
vnchast woman <i>Harlot</i>.</p>

<p>It is remembred by some, rather seruile then
fond in obseruations, who will either finde or
frame predictions for euery great action or
euent; that his mother before the time of her
deliuery had a dreame, that her bowels were
extended ouer <i>Normandie</i> and <i>England</i>. Also,
that at the time of his birth, he fell from his mothers
body to the ground; and there filled both
his hands with rushes, which had bene cast
thicke vpon the floore, and streined them with
a very streit gripe. The wiues laughed at
large, and soone grew prodigall of idle talke.
But the Midwife somewhat more soberly said;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
That he should not onely hold well his owne,
but graspe somewhat from other men.</p>

<p>When he was about 9. yeeres of age, his
father went vpon deuotion to <i>Hierusalem</i>; and
in his returne died at the Citie of <i>Nice</i>. So
<i>William</i> at that age succeeded his father; hauing
then very generous and aspiring spirits, both to
resist abroad, and to rule at home. Hee was
committed to the gouernment of two of his
vnckles; and the French King was entreated by
his father to take vpon him the protection,
both of his person and State. But his vnckles
pretended title to his dignitie, by reason of his
vnlawfull birth; the King of France also desired
much and had often attempted to reduce
<i>Normandie</i> to his absolute subiection, as it was
before the inuasion of the <i>Normans</i>. So as it
may seeme he was committed to these Tutors,
as a Lambe should be committed to the tutelage
of wolues. The onely meanes of his preseruation
consisted in a factious Nobilitie, deuided
into so many parts, as there were parties:
Some contending for possession of the yong
Dukes person; others, of his authoritie and
power; all of them incompatible to endure either
equals, or els superiours: All of them vni<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>ted
against a common enemie; all deuided among
themselues.</p>

<p>Here it may be demanded how he being
vnlawfully borne, could succeed his father in
the dutchie of <i>Normandie</i>; his father leauing
two brothers borne in lawfull marriage, and
much other legitimate kindred behind him.</p>

<p><i>Will. Malmesburie</i><a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and some others haue reported,
that albeit hee was borne out of marriage,
yet Duke <i>Robert</i> his father did afterwards
entertaine his mother for lawfull wife:
which by the Law of that Countrey, agreeable
in that point to the Ciuill and Canon Lawes,
sufficed to make the issue inheritable, although
borne before.</p>

<p>And further, it was a generall custome at
that time in France, that bastards did succeed,
euen in dignities of highest condition, no otherwise
then children lawfully begotten.
<i>Thierrie</i> bastard of <i>Clouís</i>, had for his partage
with the lawfull children of the same <i>Clouís</i>,
the Kingdome of <i>Austrasie</i>, now called <i>Lorraine</i>.
<i>Sigisbert</i> bastard of King <i>Dagobert</i> the
first, had his part in the Kingdome of France,
with <i>Clouís</i> the 12. lawfull sonne to <i>Dagobert</i>.
<i>Loys</i> and <i>Carloman</i> bastards of King <i>Loys le<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
Begue</i>, succeeded after the death of their father.
So likewise in <i>England</i>, <i>Alfride</i> bastard
sonne of <i>Oswine</i>, succeeded his brother <i>Egfride</i>.
So <i>Adelstane</i> the bastard sonne of <i>Edward</i> the
elder, succeeded his father, before <i>Edmund</i> and
<i>Eldred</i> his yonger brothers; notwithstanding
they were lawfully begotten. So <i>Edmund</i>, surnamed
the <i>Martyr</i>, Bastard sonne to King <i>Edgar</i>,
succeeded him in the state, before <i>Ethelbred</i>
his lawfull issue. Afterward, <i>Harold</i> surnamed
<i>Harefoote</i>, bastard to <i>Canutus</i>, succeeded
him in the kingdome, before <i>Hardicanutus</i>,
his lawfull sonne. The like custome hath
been obserued in <i>Spaine</i>, in <i>Portugale</i>, and in
diuers other countreys. And it is probable
that this vse was grounded vpon often experience,
that bastards (as begotten in the highest
heate and strength of affection) haue many
times been men of excellent proofe, both in
courage and in vnderstanding. This was verified<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
in <i>Hercules</i>, <i>Alexander</i> the Great, <i>Romulus</i>,
<i>Timotheus</i>, <i>Brutus</i>, <i>Themistocles</i>, <i>Arthur</i>: in
<i>Homer</i>, <i>Demosthenes</i>, <i>Bion</i>, <i>Bartholus</i>, <i>Gratian</i>,
<i>Peter Lumbard</i>, <i>Peter Comestor</i>, <i>Io. Andreas</i>, and
diuers of most flourishing name: among whom
our <i>Conquerour</i> may worthily be ranged.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span></p>

<p>And yet in the third race of the Kings of
<i>France</i> a law was made, that bastards should
not inherite the Crowne of the Realme. This
custome was likewise banished out of <i>England</i>,
and other countreys of <i>Europe</i>. Notwithstanding
in <i>France</i>, other bastards of great houses
were still aduowed.</p>

<p>The exercises of this Duke from his verie
youth were ingenuous, manly, decent, &amp; such
as tended to actiuitie and valure: Hee was of a
working minde and vehement spirit, rather
ambitious then onely desirous of glory: of a
piercing wit, blind in no mans cause, and well
sighted in his owne: of a liuely and present courage;
neither out of ignorance, or rash estimation
of dangers, but out of a true iudgement
both of himselfe and of them. In peace he was
politicke: In warre valiant and very skilfull,
both to espie, and to apprehend, and to follow
his aduantages: this valure and skill in militarie
affayres, was alwayes seconded with good
successe. He was continually accustomed both
to the weight and vse of armour, from his very
childhood. Oftentimes hee looked death in
the face with a braue contempt. He was neuer
free from actions of armes; first vpon necessity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
to defend himselfe, afterwards vpon ambition
to offend and disturbe the possessions of others.</p>

<p>In his first age he was much infested with rebels
in <i>Normandie</i>; who often conspired both
against his life, and against his dignitie and
State; traducing him, as a bastard, as a boy, as
borne of a base ignoble woman, as altogether
vnworthy to be their Prince. Of these, some he
appeased and reconciled vnto him: others he
preuented, and dispersed their power before it
was collected: others hee encountred in open
field, before he had any haire vpon his face;
where hee defeated their forces in full battell,
then tooke their strongholds, and lastly chased
them out of his dominion.</p>

<p>And first <i>Roger Tresnye</i>, hauing gained exceeding
great both fauour and reputation by
his seruices against the <i>Sarasins</i> in <i>Spaine</i>, made
claime to the duchie of <i>Normandie</i>; as one
lawfully descended from <i>Rollo</i> their first Duke.
And albeit many others were before him in
title, yet (said he) if they will sit still; if they, either
through sloath, which is ill, or through
feare, which is worse, will abandone the aduenture,
he alone would free the <i>Normans</i> from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
their infamous subiection. He was followed
by many, partly vpon opinion of his right, but
chiefly of his valour. But when he brought his
cause to the arbitrement of Armes, hee was ouerthrowne
in a strong battaile, wherein his
claime and his life determined together.</p>

<p>After this, <i>William</i> Earle of <i>Arques</i>, sonne to
<i>Richard</i> the second, and vnckle to Duke <i>William</i>,
vpon the same pretence declared himselfe
against his nephew. And albeit the <i>Normans</i>
were heauie to stirre in his fauour, yet hee so
wrought with the French King, by assuring
him great matters in <i>Normandie</i>; that with a
mightie armie of his owne people, hee went in
person, to place him in possessi&#333; of that dutchy.
The way which the King tooke, led him to a
large valley, sandie and full of short bushes and
shrubs; troublesome for horsemen either to
fight or to march. On either side were rising
hils, very thicke set with wood. Here the Armie
entred with small aduisement, either for clearing
the passage, or for the safetie of their carriages.
The Vaward consisted chiefly of battle-axes
and pikes. In the right wing were many
<i>Almans</i> among the <i>French</i>. In the left were
many of <i>Aniou</i> and <i>Poictou</i>. After these fol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>lowed
the baggage, with an infinite number of
scullians, carters and other base drudges attending
vpon it. Next came the French King
with the maine battaile, consisting for the most
part of valiant and worthy Gentlemen, brauely
mounted. The lances and men at Armes
cloased the Rereward.</p>

<p>When they were well entred this valley,
the <i>Normans</i> did liuely charge vpon them in
head; they deliuered also their deadly shot
from the hils on both sides, as thicke as haile.
Notwithstanding the Vantgard, casting themselues
into a pointed battaile in forme of a
wedge, with plaine force of hand made themselues
way; and marching in firme and close
order through the thickest of their enemies,
gained (albeit not without great losse) the top
of a hill, and there presently encamped themselues.
The like fortune happily might the residue
haue had, if they had followed with the
like order and courage. But failing herein, the
right wing was hewed in pieces: the left wing
was broken and beaten vpon the carriages;
where ouerbearing and treading downe one
an other, they receiued almost as much hurt
from themselues, as they did from their ene<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>mies.
The maine battaile and Rereward aduancing
forward to rescue the carriage, were
first miserably ouerwhelmed with a storme of
arrowes from the hill on both sides: and the
gallant horses once galled with that shot,
would no more obey or endure their riders;
but flinging out, either ouerthrew or disordred
all in their way. And the more to encrease the
miserie of that day, the dull and light sand
which was raised, partly by the feete of horses
and men, and partly by violence of the wind,
which then blew full in the faces of the <i>French</i>,
inuolued them all as in a thicke and darke
cloud; which depriued them of all foresight
and direction in gouerning their affaires. The
valiant was nothing discerned fr&#333; the coward,
no difference could be set betweene contriuance
and chance: All laboured in one common
calamitie, and euery one encreased the
feare of his fellow.</p>

<p>The <i>Normans</i> hauing well spent their shot,
and perceiuing the <i>French</i> in this sort both disordered
and dismayed, came downe from the
hils where they houered before; and falling to
the close stroke of battaile-axe and sword, most
cruelly raged in the blood of their enemies. By<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
whom if any sparke of valour was shewen, being
at so great disaduantage, it was to no purpose,
it was altogether lost; it was so farre from
relieuing others, that it was not sufficient to defend
themselues. And doubtlesse no thing so
much fauoured the state of the <i>French</i> that
day, as that the number of the <i>Normans</i> sufficed
not to enclose them behind. For then they
had bene entrapped as Deere in a toile; then
not one of them could haue escaped. But the
entrance of the valley remayning open, many
fled backe to the plaine ground; tumbling together
in such headlong hast, that if the <i>Normans</i>
had sharply put vpon them the chase, it
is certaine that they had bene extreemely defeated.
But the Duke gaue ouer the execution
vpon good aduise. For knowing himselfe not
to be of force vtterly to vanquish the <i>French</i>, he
assayed rather by faire forbearance to purchase
their friendship.</p>

<p>Here the French king assembled his broken
companies, and encamped them for that night
so well as he could. The ioy of their present
escape expelled for the time all other respects.
But after a little breathing, their remembrance
began to runne vpon the losse of their cariages;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
whereby they had lost all meanes to refresh
themselues. Of their Vaward they made a
forelorne reckoning, and the like did the Vaward
of them. Many were wounded, all wearied;
and the <i>Normans</i> gaue notice by sounding
out their instruments of warre, that they
were at hand on euery side. The rudest of the
Souldiers did boldly vpbraid this infortunitie
to the King; one asked him where his Vaward
was, where were his wings, where were the residue
of his battell, and Rereward. Others called
for the cariages, to preserue those in life
who had not been slaine. Others demanded
if he had any more mouse-traps to leade them
into. But most sate heauy and pensiue, scarce
accounting themselues among the liuing. The
King swallowed downe all with a sad silence,
sometimes he dissembled as though he had not
heard; sometimes hee would fairely answere;
<i>Good words, good souldiers; haue patience a while,
and all will be well</i>: which was indeede a truer
word then he thought it possible to bee when
he spake it.</p>

<p>In this extremity the King assembled the
chiefe of his commanders, to aduise with them
what was best to be done. It was generally con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>cluded,
that in staying their case was desperate;
and dangerous it was to stirre. But here lay
the question; whether it was least dangerous
to remoue together, or euery man to shift for
himselfe. Whilest this point was in debating,
whilest they expected euery minute to be assailed,
whilest no man saw any thing but death
and despaire; behold, a messenger came from
the Duke, not to offer but to desire peace; and
to craue protection of the French king, according
to the trust which <i>Robert</i> the Dukes father
reposed in him. There needed not many
words to perswade. Peace was signed, protection
assured, in a more ample maner then it was
required. Then the messenger with many good
words appeased the Kings heauinesse, telling
him, that his Vaward was safe, his cariages not
touched, and that he should be furnished with
horses both for burthen and draught, in stead
of those that had been slaine. These words, as
a sweete enchantment, rauished the <i>French</i>
King with sudden ioy. But when they came to
gather vp their baggage, a spectacle both lamentable
and loathsome was presented vnto
them. The valley couered, and in some places
heaped with dead bodies of men and horses:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
many not once touched with any weapon,
lay troden to death, or else stifled with dust
and sand: many grieuously wounded, reteined
some remainder of life, which they expressed
with cries and groanes: many not mortally
hurt, were so ouerlaid with the slaine, that
they were vnable to free themselues: towards
whom it is memorable, what manly both pitie
and helpe the <i>Normans</i> did affoord. And
so the <i>French</i> King more by courtesie of his
enemies, then either by courage or discretion
of his owne, returned in reasonable state
to <i>Paris</i>.</p>

<p>Vpon these euents of open hostilitie, <i>Guy</i>
Earle of <i>Burgogne</i>, who had taken to wife <i>Alix</i>,
daughter to Duke <i>Richard</i> the second, and
Aunt to Duke <i>William</i>, conspired with <i>Nicellus</i>
president of <i>Constantine</i>, <i>Ranulph</i> Vicecount of
<i>Bayon</i>, <i>Baimond</i>, and diuers others, suddenly
to surprise the Duke, and slay him in the night.
A certaine foole, (nothing regarded for his
want of wit) obseruing their preparations, secretly
got away, and in the dead of the night
came to <i>Valogne</i>, where the Duke then lay; no
lesse slenderly guarded with men, then the
place it selfe was sleight for defence. Here he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
continued rapping at the gate, and crying
out, vntill it was opened, and hee brought to
the presence of the Duke. To whom he declared
the conspiracie, with circumstances of
such moment, that the Duke foorthwith
tooke his horse, and posted alone towards
<i>Falais</i>, an especial place for strength for defence.
Presently after his departure the conspirators
came to <i>Valogne</i>, they beset the house, they enter
by force, they search euery corner for the
Duke: And finding that the game was start,
and on foote, in hote haste they pursued the
chase.</p>

<p>About breake of day the Dukes horse tired,
and he was ignorant of his right way. He was
then at a little village called <i>Rie</i>, where the
chiefe Gentleman of the place was standing at
his doore ready to goe abroad. Of him the
Duke enquired the next way to <i>Falais</i>. The
Gentleman knew the Duke, and with all duetie
and respect desired to know the cause of his
both solitarie and vntimely riding. The Duke
would willingly haue passed vnknowne; but
perceiuing himselfe to be discouered, declared
to him the whole aduenture. Hereupon the
Gentleman furnished him with a fresh horse,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
and sent with him two of his sonnes to conduct
him the direct way to <i>Falais</i>.</p>

<p>No sooner were they out of sight, but the
conspirators came, and enquired of the same
Gentleman (who still remained at his doore)
whether he saw not the Duke that morning: as
if, forsooth, they were come to attend him.
The Gentleman answered, that he was gone a
little before, and therewith offered them his
company to ouertake him. But he lead them about
another way, vntill the Duke was safely
alighted at <i>Falais</i>. And thus the more we consider
these and the like passages of affaires, the
lesse we shall admire either the wisdome, or industry,
or any other sufficiencie of man. In actions
of weight it is good to employ our best endeuours;
but when all is done, he danceth well
to whom Fortune doeth pipe.</p>

<p>When the conspirators vnderstood that
their principall purpose was disappointed, they
made themselues so powerfull in the field, that
the Duke was enforced to craue ayde of the
King of <i>France</i>; who not long before was his
greatest enemie. The King preferring to his
remembrance the late honourable dealing of
the Duke, came in person vnto him; by whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
countenance and aide the Duke ouerthrew his
enemies in a full battell, in the vale of <i>Dunes</i>:
albeit not without great difficultie, and bold
aduenture of his owne person. <i>Guy de Burgogne</i>
escaped by flight, and defended himselfe
in certaine castles which he had fortified in
<i>Normandie</i> for his retreite; but in the end hee
rendred both himselfe and them to the Dukes
discretion. The Duke not onely pardoned
him, but honoured him with a liberall pension;
which he did afterward both with valiant and
loyall seruice requite.</p>

<p>Not long after, the French King had wars
against <i>Ieoffrey Martell</i>, and Duke <i>William</i> went
with a faire companie of Souldiers to his ayde.
In this seruice he so wel acquited himselfe, both
in iudgement and with hand, that the French
King was chiefly directed by him; onely blaming
him for too carelesse casting himselfe into
the mouth of dangers; imputing that to ostentation,
which was but the heate of his courage
and age. Oftentimes hee would range
from the maine battell with very fewe in his
company; either to make discoueries, or to encounter
such enemies as could not bee found
with greater troupes. Once hee withdrew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
himselfe onely with foure, and was met with
by fifteene of the enemies. The most forward
of them he strake from his horse, and brake his
thigh with the fall. The residue hee chased
foure miles; and most of them being hurt, tooke
seuen prisoners. Hereupon <i>Ieoffrey Martell</i>
then said of him; that he was at that time the
best souldier, and was like to prooue the best
commander in the world.</p>

<p>And as hee was both fauourable and faithfull
towards them who fairely yeelded, so against
such as either obstinately or scornefully
caried themselues, he was extreamely seuere,
or rather cruell. When hee besieged <i>Alençon</i>,
which the Duke of <i>Aniou</i> had taken from
him, the defendants would often crie from the
walles, <i>La pel, La pel</i>; reproaching him thereby
with the birth of his mother. This base insolencie,
as it enflamed both his desire and courage
to atchieue the enterprise, so did it his fury, to
deale sharpely with them when they were subdued;
by cutting off their hands and feete; and
by other seuerities which were not vsuall.</p>

<p>Besides these, some others of his owne blood
prouoked <i>Engelrame</i> Earle of <i>Ponthieu</i> to moue
against him in armes: but the Duke receiued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
him with so resolute valour, that the Earle was
slaine in the field, and they well chastised who
drew him to the enterprise. The <i>Britaines</i> did
often feele the force of his victorious armes.
Hee had many conflicts with <i>Ieoffrey Martell</i>
Earle of <i>Aniou</i>, confederate with the Princes of
<i>Britane</i>, <i>Aquitaine</i>, and <i>Tours</i>; a man equall vnto
him both in power and in skill to command,
but in fortune and in force of arme much inferiour.
Many excellent atchieuements were
performed betweene them; insomuch as their
hostilitie seemed onely to bee an emulation in
honour. Once the Duke fell into an ambushment
addressed for him by the Earle of <i>Aniou</i>;
wherewith he was so suddenly surprized, that
he was almost in the midst of the danger before
he thought any danger neere him. An exceeding
great both terrour and confusion seazed
vpon his souldiers; because the more sudden
and vncertaine a perill is, the greater is it alwayes
esteemed. Many of his brauest men
were slaine; the residue so disordered, or at
least shaken, as they began to thinke more of
their particular escape, then of the common either
safety or glory.</p>

<p>When they were thus vpon the point to dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>band,
the Duke rather with rage then courage
cried vnto them, <i>If you loue me not Souldiers, yet
for shame follow me; for shame stand by mee; for
shame let not any of your friends heare the report,
that you ran from mee and left me fighting.</i> With
that he threw himselfe into the thickest throng
of his enimies, and denounced those either
traitours or cowards who would not follow.
This example breathed such braue life into his
Souldiers, that they rallied their loose rankes,
and in close order seconded him with a resolute
charge: encouraging one another, that it
was shameful indeede not to fight for him, who
so manfully did fight with them. The Duke
brandishing his sword like a thunderbolt, dung
downe his enemies on euery side; made at
Earle <i>Martell</i> in the midst of his battallion,
strake him downe, claue his helmet, and cut away
one of his eares. This so diuerted the <i>Aniouans</i>
to the rescue of their Earle, that they let
the other part of the victorie goe. The Earle
they recouered againe to horse, and so left the
Duke master of the field. Verely, it is almost
impossible, that a commander of such courage
should haue, either faint or false hearted
Souldiers.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span></p>

<p>Now it happened not long before, that <i>Fulc</i>
Earle of <i>Aniou</i> hauing drawen <i>Herbert</i> Earle of
<i>Maine</i> vnder faire pretenses to <i>Xantonge</i>, cast
him in prison, from whence he could not be released
vntill he had yeelded to certaine conditions,
both dishonourable and disaduantageable
vnto him. <i>Hugh</i> succeded <i>Herbert</i>; from
whom <i>Ieoffrey Martell</i> Earle of <i>Aniou</i> tooke the
citie of <i>Maine</i>, and made himselfe lord of all the
countrey. <i>Hugh</i> hauing lost his dominion, left
both his title and his quarrell to his sonne <i>Herbert</i>:
who hauing no issue, appointed Duke
<i>William</i> to bee his heire. Hereupon the Duke
inuaded <i>Maine</i>, and in short time subdued the
whole countrey, and built two fortifications for
assurance thereof; hauing first sent word to the
Earle of <i>Aniou</i>, vp&#333; what day the worke should
begin. The Earle vsed all diligence and means
to impeach the buildings; but hee not onely
failed of that purpose, but further lost the countie
of <i>Medune</i>.</p>

<p>Againe, <i>Henry</i> King of <i>France</i> did many other
times with great preparation inuade his
Countrey; sometimes with purpose to winne
vpon him, and sometimes to keepe him from
winning vpon others. Vpon a time the King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
led his troupes ouer the foord of <i>Dine</i>; and
when halfe his army had passed, the other halfe
by reason of the rising of the Sea, was compelled
to stay. The Duke apprehending the aduantage,
came vp&#333; them with a furious charge,
being now deuided from the chiefe of the Armie;
and either slew them or tooke them prisoners,
in the plaine view of their King. After
this they concluded a peace, whereof the conditions
were, That the Duke should release
such prisoners as he had taken; and that hee
should retaine whatsoeuer he had wonne, or
afterwards should winne from the Earle of <i>Aniou</i>.
And yet the King did againe enterprise
vpon him, with greater forces then at any time
before: But the Duke entertained his Armies
with so good order and valoure, that the King
gained nothing but losse and dishonour: and
the greater his desire was of victorie and reuenge,
the more foule did his foiles and failings
appeare; which so brake both his courage and
heart, that with griefe thereof (as it was conceiued)
hee ended his life. And thus during all
the time that he was onely Duke of <i>Normandy</i>,
he was neuer free from action of armes: in all
his actions of armes hee was caried with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
most rare and perpetuall felicitie.</p>

<p>As he grew in yeeres, so did he in thicknesse
and fatnesse of body: but so, as it made him
neither vnseemely, nor vnseruiceable for the
warres; and neuer much exceeding the measure
of a comely corpulencie. He was most decent,
and therewith terrible in armes. He was stately
and maiesticall in his gesture; of a good stature,
but in strength admirable: in so much as
no man was able to draw his bow, which hee
would bend sitting vpon his horse, stretching
out the string with his foot. His countenance
was warlike and manly as his friends might
terme it; but as his enemies said, truculent and
fierce. He would often sweare <i>By Gods resurrection
and his brightnesse</i>: which he commonly
pronounced with so furious a face, that hee
strooke a terrour into those that were present.
His head was bald; his beard alwayes shauen;
which fashion being first taken vp by him, was
then followed by all the <i>Normans</i>. Hee was of
a firme and strong constitution for his health;
so as he neuer was attached with sicknesse, but
that which was the summons of his death: and
in his age seemed little to feele the heauie
weight and burthen of yeeres.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span></p>

<p>In his first age he was of a mild and gentle
disposition; courteous, bountifull, familiar in
conuersation, a professed enemie to all vices.
But as in Fortune, as in yeres, so changed he in
his behauiour; partly by his continuall following
the warres (whereby he was much fleshed
in blood) and partly by the inconstant nature
of the people ouer whom he ruled: who by often
rebellions did not onely exasperate him to
some seueritie, but euen constraine him to hold
them in with a more stiffe arme. So hee did
wring from his subiects very much substance,
very much blood; not for that he was by nature
either couetous or cruell, but for that his
affaires could not otherwise be managed. His
great affaires could not be managed without
great expence, which drew a necessity of charge
vpon the people: neither could the often rebellions
of his Subiects be repressed or restrained
by any mild and moderate meanes. And generally
as in all States and gouernments, seuere
discipline hath alwayes bin a true faithfull mother
of vertue and valour; so in particular of his
<i>Normans</i> he learned by experience, and oftentimes
declared this iudgement: That if they
were held in bridle, they were most valiant, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
almost inuincible; excelling all men both in courage,
and in strength, and in honourable desire
to vanquish their enemies. But if the reines
were layd loose vpon their necke, they were apt
to runne into licentiousnes and mischiefe; ready
to consume either themselues by riot and
sloath, or one another by sedition: prone to
innouation and change; as heauily mooued to
vndertake dangers, so not to bee trusted vpon
occasion.</p>

<p>He tooke to wife <i>Matilde</i> daughter to <i>Baldwin</i>
Earle of <i>Flanders</i>, a man for his wisedome
and power, both reuerenced and feared euen
of Kings; but because she was his cousin Germane,
he was for his marriage excommunicate
by his owne vnckle <i>Mauger</i> Archbishop of
<i>Roan</i>. Hereupon he sued to Pope <i>Victor</i>, and
obteined of him a dispensation: and afterwards
so wrought, that by a prouinciall Councell his
vncle <i>Mauger</i> was depriued of his dignitie. But
by this meanes both he &amp; his issue were firmely
locked in obedience to the Sea of <i>Rome</i>; for that
vpon the authoritie of that place the validitie
of his marriage, and consequently the legitimation
of his issue seemed to depend.</p>

<p>When he was about 50. yeeres of age, <i>Edward</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
King of <i>England</i> ended his life. This <i>Edward</i>
was sonne to <i>Egelred</i> King of <i>England</i>, by
<i>Emma</i>, sister to <i>Richard</i> the second Duke of
<i>Normandie</i>, who was grandfather to Duke
<i>William</i>: so as King <i>Edward</i> and Duke <i>William</i>
were cousins germane once remoued.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>At such time as <i>Egelred</i> was first ouercharged
with warres by the <i>Danes</i>, he sent his wife
<i>Emma</i>, with two sonnes which she had borne
vnto him, <i>Alphred</i> and <i>Edward</i>, into <i>Normandie</i>
to her brother; where they were enterteined
with all honourable vsage for many yeeres. Afterward
giuing place to the malice of his Fortune,
he passed also into <i>Normandie</i>, and left
his whole state in the possession and power of
<i>Swanus</i> King of <i>Denmarke</i>. But after the death
of <i>Swanus</i>, partly by the aide of the <i>Normans</i>,
and partly by fauour of his owne people, he recouered
his Kingdome, and left the same to his
eldest sonne <i>Edmund</i>, who either for the tough
temper of his courage and strength, or for that
he almost alwayes liued in Armes, was surnamed
<i>Ironside</i>.</p>

<p>Hereupon <i>Canutus</i> the sonne of <i>Swanus</i>
made sharpe warre, first against <i>Egelred</i>, then
against <i>Edmund</i>: and finally after many varie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>ties
of aduenture, but chiefly by the fauour of
the Clergie of <i>England</i> (because they had
sworne allegiance to his father) spread the
wings of his victory ouer the whole Kingdome.
He expelled out of the Realme <i>Edwine</i> and <i>Edward</i>
the two sonnes of King <i>Edmund</i>: of whom
<i>Edwine</i> married the Kings daughter of <i>Hungarie</i>,
but died without issue; <i>Edward</i> was aduanced
to the marriage of <i>Agatha</i>, daughter to
the Emperour <i>Henry</i>, and by her had issue two
sonnes, <i>Edmund</i> &amp; <i>Edgar</i>, and so many daughters,
<i>Margaret</i> and <i>Christine</i>. The same <i>Canutus</i>
tooke <i>Emma</i> to wife, who had bene wife
to King <i>Egelred</i>; by whom he had a sonne named
<i>Hardicanutus</i>.</p>

<p>After the death of <i>Canutus</i>, <i>Alphred</i> the sonne
of <i>Egelred</i> came out of <i>Normandie</i>, and with fiftie
saile landed at <i>Sandwich</i>: with purpose to attempt
the recouerie of his fathers kingdome.
In which enterprise hee receiued not onely
encouragement, but good assurance from many
of the <i>English</i> Nobilitie. But by Earle <i>Goodwine</i>
he was abused and taken; his company
slaine, his eyes put out, and then sent to the Ile
of <i>Elie</i>, where in short time hee ended his life.
<i>Edward</i> also arriued at <i>Hampton</i> with 40. ships,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
but finding the Countrey so farre from receiuing,
as they were ready to resist him, he returned
into <i>Normandie</i>, and attended the further
fauour of time. So after <i>Canutus</i> succeeded in
<i>England</i>, first <i>Harold</i> sirnamed <i>Harefoot</i>, bastard
sonne to <i>Canutus</i>; and after him <i>Hardicanutus</i>,
sonne to <i>Canutus</i> by <i>Emma</i>, mother also to
King <i>Edward</i>.</p>

<p><i>Hardicanutus</i> being dead, the Nobilitie of
the Realme sent into <i>Normandie</i> for <i>Edward</i> to
be their King; whereto also he was appointed
as some haue written by <i>Hardicanutus</i>. But because
<i>Alphred</i> his brother vpon the like inuitation
had bene traiterously taken and slaine before,
<i>William</i> at that time Duke of <i>Normandie</i>
would not permit him to depart, vntill he had
receiued for pledges of his safety, <i>Woolnoth</i> son
to Earle <i>Goodwine</i>, and <i>Hacon</i> sonne to <i>Swaine</i>,
Earle <i>Goodwins</i> eldest sonne. Vpon this assurance
he was furnished by the duke his cousin,
with all meanes fit both for his enterprise and
estate. And so hee passed the Seas, arriued in
<i>England</i>, and with generall ioy was receiued for
King. He tooke to wife <i>Edith</i> the daughter of
Earle <i>Goodwine</i>; but whether vpon vow of chastitie,
or whether vpon impotencie of nature, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
whether vpon hatred to her father, or whether
vpon suspition against herselfe (for all these
causes are alleaged by seuerall writers of
those times) he forbore all priuate familiaritie
with her.</p>

<p>When he was well locked into the chaire of
State, Duke <i>William</i> came out of <i>Normandie</i> to
see him, to shew his magnificence to the <i>English</i>
people; to shew to the <i>English</i>, both that he
loued their King, and that he was of power to
relieue him, in case his necessities should so require.
Here, besides honourable enterteinement,
besides many rich gifts both to himselfe
and to his followers, the King hauing neither
hope nor desire of issue, promised him, in regard
of his great fauours and deserts, that hee
should be his next successour in the Kingdome.
And for further assurance thereof, sent him also
the like message into <i>Normandie</i>, by <i>Robert</i>
Archbishop of <i>Canterburie</i>.</p>

<p>After this <i>Harold</i> sonne to Earle <i>Goodwine</i>
passed the Seas into <i>Normandie</i>, to deale for
the discharge of his brother <i>Wolnoth</i> and <i>Hacon</i>
his nephew, who had bene deliuered for hostages
to the Duke. In his passage he was much
tossed with troublesome weather, and in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
end was cast vpon the coast of <i>Ponthieu</i>, and
there taken by the Earle and committed to prison.
But at the request of the Duke of <i>Normandie</i>,
hee was released with honourable respect,
and by the Earle himselfe accompanied to the
Duke; who enterteined him with great magnificence
at <i>Roan</i>. The Duke was then going
in Armes against the <i>Britaines</i>; in which iourney
<i>Harold</i> did accompany him, and shewed
himselfe a man, neither rash in vndertaking,
nor fearefull in perfourming any seruices of the
field. After prosperous returne, the Duke declared
to <i>Harold</i>, the purpose of King <i>Edward</i>
c&#333;cerning the Dukes succession to this Crowne.
<i>Harold</i> did auow the same to be true; and promised
to affoord thereto the best furtherance
that he could. Hereupon the Duke assembled a
Councell at <i>Boneuill</i>; where <i>Harold</i> did sweare
fidelitie vnto him: and promised likewise by
oath, that after the death of King <i>Edward</i>, he
would keepe the Realme of <i>England</i> to the vse
of the Duke: that he would deliuer vnto him
the castle of <i>Douer</i>, and certaine other pieces of
defence, furnished at his owne charge. Hereupon
the Duke promised vnto him his daughter
in marriage, and with her halfe the Realme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
of <i>England</i> in name of her dower. He also deliuered
to him his nephew <i>Hacon</i>; but kept his
brother <i>Wolnoth</i> as an hostage, for performance
of that which <i>Harold</i> had sworne.</p>

<p>In short time after King <i>Edward</i> died, and
<i>Harold</i> being generall commander of the forces
of the Realme, seized vpon the soueraignetie,
and without any accustomed solemnities set
the crowne vpon his owne head. The people
were nothing curious to examine titles; but as
men broken with long bondage, did easily entertaine
the first pretender. And yet to <i>Harold</i>
they were inclinable enough, as well vpon
opinion of his prowesse, as for that hee endeauoured
to winne their fauour, partly by abating
their grieuous paiments, and partly by increasing
the wages of his seruants and Souldiers;
generally, by vsing iustice with clemencie
and courtesie towards all. About this time a
blasing starre appeared and continued the
space of seuen dayes;<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> which is commonly taken
to portend alteration in States. Of this Comet
a certaine Poet, alluding to the baldnesse
of the <i>Norman</i>, wrote these verses.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Cæsariem Cæsar tibi si natura negauit,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Hanc Willielme tibi stella comata dedit.</i><br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span></div></div>

<p>Duke <i>William</i> sent diuers Ambassadours to
<i>Harold</i>; first to demaund perfourmance of his
oath, afterward to mooue him to some moderate
agreement. But ambition, a reasonlesse
and restlesse humour, made him obstinate against
all offers or inducements of peace. So
they prepared to buckle in armes; equall both
in courage and in ambitious desires, equall in
confidence of their fortune: but <i>Harold</i> was the
more aduenturous, <i>William</i> the more aduised
man: <i>Harold</i> was more strong in Souldiers,
<i>William</i> in Alies and friends.</p>

<p><i>Harold</i> was seated in possession, which in
case of a kingdome is oftentimes with facilitie
attained, but retained hardly: <i>William</i> pretended
the donation of King <i>Edward</i>, and that he
was neere vnto him in blood by the mothers
side.</p>

<p>Now there wanted not precedents, both ancient
and of later times, that free kingdomes
and principalities, not setled by custome in succession
of blood, haue been transported euen
to strangers by way of guift. <i>Attalus</i> king of
<i>Pergamus</i><a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> did constitute the people of <i>Rome</i>
his heire; by force wherof they made his kingdome
a part of their empire. <i>Nicomedes</i> King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
of <i>Bithynia</i><a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> made the people of <i>Rome</i> likewise
his heire; whereupon his kingdome was reduced
to the forme of a Prouince. So <i>Alexander</i>
King of <i>Egypt</i>,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> gaue <i>Alexandria</i> and the
kingdome of <i>Egypt</i>; and so <i>Ptolemie</i> gaue the
kingdome of <i>Cyrene</i> to the same people of
<i>Rome</i>. <i>Prasutagus</i><a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> one of the kings of great <i>Britaine</i>,
gaue the kingdome of the <i>Iceni</i> to <i>Cæsar
Nero</i>, and to his daughters. Yea, in the Imperial
state of <i>Rome</i>, <i>Augustus</i> designed <i>Tiberius</i> to
be his successour; and by like appointment <i>Nero</i>
became successour to <i>Claudius</i>; <i>Traiane</i> to
<i>Nerua</i>; <i>Antonius Pius</i> to <i>Adrian</i>; and <i>Antoninus</i>
the Philosopher to another <i>Antoninus</i>.
When the Emperour <i>Galba</i><a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> did openly appoint
<i>Piso</i> for his successour, he declared to the
people, that the same custome had been obserued
by most approued and ancient Princes.
<i>Iugurth</i> being adopted by <i>Mycipsa</i>,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> succeeded
him in the kingdome of <i>Numidia</i>; and that by
the iudgement as well of <i>Mycipsa</i> himselfe, as of
the Senate and people of <i>Rome</i>.</p>

<p>The holy histories report that <i>Salomon</i><a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> gaue
twentie cities to <i>Hiram</i> king of <i>Tyre</i>: and if the
argument be good from the part to the whole,
he might in like sort haue disposed of all his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
kingdome. Who hath not heard of the donation
falsly attributed to <i>Constantine</i> the great,
being in trueth the donation of <i>Lewis</i>, sirnamed
the pious; whereby he gaue to Pope <i>Paschal</i>
the citie of <i>Rome</i>, and a large territorie adioyning
vnto it; the instrument of which gift
<i>Volaterrane</i><a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> doth recite. So the Ladie <i>Matild</i>,
daughter to <i>Roger</i> the most famous Prince of
<i>Cicilie</i>, and wife to king <i>Conrade</i>, sonne to <i>Henrie</i><a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
the 4. Emperour, gaue the Marquisate of
<i>Apulia</i> to the Bishop of <i>Rome</i>: which when the
Emperour <i>Otho</i> the 4. refused to deliuer, hee
was for that cause excommunicate by the Pope.
In like sort the countrey of <i>Daulphin</i><a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> was giuen
by Prince <i>Vmbert</i> to the King of <i>France</i>, vpon
condition, that the eldest sonne of <i>France</i>
should afterward be called <i>Daulphine</i>. Lastly,
the Dukes first auncestor <i>Rollo</i>, receiued the
Dukedome of <i>Normandie</i> by donation of
<i>Charles</i> King of <i>France</i>: And himselfe held the
Countie of <i>Maine</i> by donation of Earle <i>Herebert</i>,
as before it is shewed. And by donation
of the King of <i>Britaine</i>, <i>Hengist</i> obtained <i>Kent</i>;
the first kingdome of the English Saxons in
<i>Britaine</i>. After which time the Countrey was
neuer long time free from inuasion: first, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
the English and Saxons against the Britaines,
afterward by the seuen <i>Saxon</i> kingdomes among
themselues, and then lastly by the <i>Danes</i>.
By meanes whereof the kingdome at that time
could not bee setled in any certaine forme of
succession by blood, as it hath been since; but
was held for the most part in absolute dominion,
and did often passe by transaction or gift:
and he whose sword could cut best, was alwaies
adiudged to haue most right. But of this question
more shall hereafter be said, in the beginning
of the life of King <i>William</i> the second.</p>

<p>Touching his propinquity in blood to King
<i>Edward</i> by the mothers side, he enforced it to
be a good title: because King <i>Edward</i> not long
before had taken succession from <i>Hardicanutus</i>,
to whom hee was brother by the mothers
side. And although King <i>Edward</i> was also
descended from the <i>Saxon</i> Kings, yet could not
he deriue from them any right: For that <i>Edgar</i>
and his sisters were then aliue, descended from
<i>Edmund Ironside</i>, elder brother to King <i>Edward</i>.
Hee could haue no true right of succession, but
onely from <i>Hardicanutus</i> the <i>Dane</i>. So <i>Pepine</i>,
when he was possessed of the State of <i>France</i>,
did openly publish, that hee was descended of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
the blood of <i>Charles</i> the Great, by the mothers
side. And albeit the said <i>Edgar</i> was both neerer
to King <i>Edward</i> then the Duke of <i>Normandie</i>,
and also ioyned to him in blood by the fathers
side; yet was that no sufficient defence
for <i>Harold</i>. The vsurped possession of <i>Harold</i><a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
could not be defended, by alleaging a better title
of a third person. The iniurie which hee
did to <i>Edgar</i>, could not serue him for a title against
any other.</p>

<p>These grounds of his pretence, beautified
with large amplifications of the benefits which
he had done to King <i>Edward</i>, he imparted to
the Bishop of <i>Rome</i>; who at time was reputed
the arbitrator of controuersies which did rise
betweene princes. And the rather to procure
his fauour, and to gaine the countenance of religion
to his cause, hee promised to hold the
kingdome of <i>England</i> of the Apostolike Sea.
Hereupon <i>Alexander</i> then Bishop of <i>Rome</i> allowed
his title, and sent vnto him a white hallowed
banner, to aduance vpon the prowe of
his ship: also an <i>Agnus Dei</i> of gold, and one of
S. <i>Peters</i> haires, together with his blessing to
begin the enterprise.</p>

<p>But now concerning his further procee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>dings,
concerning his victorious both entrance
and c&#333;tinuance within the Realme of <i>England</i>,
two points are worthy to be considered: one,
how he being a man of no great either power
or dominion, did so suddenly preuaile against
a couragious King, possessed of a large and
puissant State. The other is, how he so secured
his victorie, as not the English, not the Britains,
not the Danes, not any other could dispossesse
or much disturbe him &amp; his posteritie, from enioying
the fayre fruits thereof. And if we giue
to either of these their true respects, wee shall
find his commendation to consist, not so much
in the first, as in the second: because that was
effected chiefly by force, this by wisedome only;
which as it is most proper to man, so few
men doe therein excell. Hee that winneth a
State surmounteth onely outward difficulties;
but he that assureth the same, trauaileth as well
against internall weaknes, as external strength.
To attaine a Kingdome is many times a gift
of Fortune; but to prouide that it may long
time continue firme, is not onely to oppose against
humane forces, but against the very
malice of Fortune, or rather the power and
wrath of time, whereby all things are na<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>turally
inclineable to change.</p>

<p>For the first then, besides the secret working
and will of God, which is the cause of all causes;
besides the sinnes of the people, for which (the
Prophet saith,) <i>Kingdomes are transported from
one Nation to another</i>: King <i>Edward</i> not long
before made a manifest way for this inuasion
and change. For although he was <i>English</i> by
birth, yet by reason of his education in <i>Normandie</i>,
he was altogether become a <i>Normane</i>,
both in affection and in behauiour of life. So as
in imitation of him, the <i>English</i> abandoned the
ancient vsages of their Country, and with great
affection or affectation rather, conformed
themselues to the fashions of <i>France</i>.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> His
chiefe acquaintance and familiar friends were
no other then <i>Normans</i>; towards whom being
a milde and soft spirited Prince, he was very
bountifull, and almost immoderate in his fauours.
These he enriched with great possessions;
these he honoured with the highest places
both of dignitie and charge. Chiefly he aduanced
diuers of them to the best degrees of
dignitie in the Church: by whose fauour Duke
<i>William</i> afterward was both animated &amp; aided
in his exploit. Generally as the whole Clergie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
of <i>England</i> conceiued a hard opinion of <i>Harold</i>;
for that vpon the same day wherein King
<i>Edward</i> was buried, he set the Crowne vpon his
owne head, without Religious Ceremonies,
without any solemnities of Coronation: so they
durst not for feare of the Popes displeasure, but
giue either furtherance or forbearance to the
Dukes proceedings; and to abuse the credite
which they had with the people, in working
their submission to the <i>Normans</i>. Now of what
strength the Clergie was at that time within
the Realme, by this which followeth it may
appeare.</p>

<p>After that <i>Harold</i> was slaine, <i>Edwine</i> and
<i>Morcar</i> Earles of <i>Northumberland</i> and <i>Marckland</i>,
brothers of great both authoritie and
power within the Realme, had induced many
of the Nobilitie to declare <i>Edgar Athelinge</i> to be
their King: but the Prelates not onely crossed
that purpose, but deliuered <i>Edgar</i> the next
heire from the <i>Saxon</i> Kings to the pleasure of
the Duke.</p>

<p>Againe, when the Duke after his great victorie
at <i>Hastings</i> aduanced his armie towards
<i>Hartford-shire</i>; <i>Fredericke</i> Abbot of <i>S. Albanes</i>
had caused the woods belonging to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
Church to be felled, and the trees to be cast so
thicke in the way, that the Duke was compelled
to coast about to the castle of <i>Berkhamstead</i>.
To this place the Abbot vnder Suerties came
vnto him; and being demanded wherefore he
alone did offer that opposition against him,
with a confident countenance he returned answere:
that he had done no more then in conscience
and by Nature he was bound to doe:
and that if the residue of the Clergie had borne
the like minde, hee should neuer haue pierced
the land so farre. Well, answered the
Duke, I know that your Clergie is powerfull indeed;
but if I liue and prosper in my affaires, I
shall gouerne their greatnesse well ynough.
Assuredly, nothing doeth sooner worke the
conuersion or subuersion of a State, then that
any one sort of Subiects should grow so great,
as to be able to ouerrule all the rest.</p>

<p>Besides this disposition of the Clergie, diuers
of the Nobilitie also did nothing fauour King
<i>Harold</i> or his cause: for that he was a manifest
vsurper, naked of all true title to the Crowne,
pretending onely as borne of the daughter of
<i>Hardicanutus</i> the <i>Dane</i>. Yea he was infamous
both for his iniurie and periurie towards the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
Duke, and no lesse hatefull for his disloyaltie
in former times, in bearing Armes with his father
against King <i>Edward</i>. Hereupon the Nobilitie
of the Realme were broken into factions.
Many (of whom his owne brother <i>Tosto</i> was
chiefe) inuited <i>Harold</i> King of <i>Norway</i> to inuade;
with whom whilest <i>Harold</i> of <i>England</i>
was incountring in Armes, the residue drew in
Duke <i>William</i> out of <i>Normandie</i>. And these also
were diuided in respects. Some were caried
by particular ends, as being prepared in diuers
maner by the <i>Normane</i> before hand: others
vpon a greedy and for the most part deceiueable
ambition, in hunting after hazard and
change: others were led with loue to their
Countrey, partly to auoyd the tempest which
they saw to gather in clouds against them, and
partly to enlarge the Realme both in dominion
and strength, by adioyning the Country
of <i>Normandie</i> vnto it. In which regard, (because
the lesse doeth alwayes accrue to the
greater) they thought it more aduantageable
to deale with a Prince of an inferiour state,
then with a Prince of a state superiour or equal.</p>

<p>As for <i>Edgar Atheling</i>, the next successour to
the Crowne in right of blood, he was not of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
sufficient age; of a simple wit and slow courage;
not gracious to the <i>English</i>, as well for his
imperfections both in yeeres and nature, as for
that he was altogether vnacquainted with the
customes and conditions of their Countrey:
vnfurnished of forces and reputation, vnfurnished
of friends, vnfurnished of all meanes to
support his title. So Duke <i>William</i> hauing better
right then the one, and more power then
the other, did easily cary the prize from both.</p>

<p>Now touching the state of his owne
strength, albeit <i>Normandie</i> was but little in regard
of <i>England</i>, yet was it neither feeble nor
poore. For the people, by reason of their continuall
exercise in Armes, by reason of the
weightie warres which they had managed,
were well inabled both in courage and skill for
all Militarie atchieuements. Their valour also
had bene so fauoured by their Fortune, that
they were more enriched by spoile, then
drawne downe either with losses or with
charge. Hereupon when preparation was to
be made for the enterprise of <i>England</i>, although
some disswaded the Duke from embracing the
attempt; affirming that it was a vaine thing to
streine at that which the hand is not able to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
conteine, to take more meat then the stomacke
can beare; that he who catcheth at matters too
great, is in great danger to gripe nothing: Yet
did others not onely encourage him by aduise,
but enable him by their aide. Among which
<i>William Fitz-Auber</i> did furnish 40. ships with
men and munition; The Bishop of <i>Baieux</i> likewise
40: the Bishop of <i>Mans</i> 30: and in like
sort others, according to the proportion of
their estates.</p>

<p>And yet he drew not his forces onely out of
<i>Normandie</i>, but receiued aide from all parts of
<i>France</i>; answerable not onely to his necessitie,
but almost to his desire. <i>Philip</i> King of <i>France</i>
at that time was vnder age, and <i>Baldwine</i> Earle
of <i>Flanders</i> was gouernour of the Realme;
whose daughter the Duke had taken to wife.
By his fauour the Duke receiued large supplies
from the state of <i>France</i>, both in treasure and in
men of warre: for countenance whereof it was
giuen foorth, that the Duke should hold the
Realme of <i>England</i> as hee did the Duchie of
<i>Normandie</i>, vnder homage to the Crowne of
<i>France</i>. Hereupon diuers Princes of <i>France</i>
did adioyne to his aide; and especially the
Duke of <i>Orleance</i>, the Earles of <i>Britaine</i>, <i>Aniou</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
<i>Boloigne</i>, <i>Ponthieu</i>, <i>Neuers</i>, <i>Poictou</i>, <i>Hiesmes</i>,
<i>Aumale</i>, and the Lord of <i>Tours</i>. Many other of
the Nobilitie and Gentlemen did voluntarily
aduenture, both their bodies and whole estates
vpon the euent of this enterprise. So greatly
had he either by courtesie wonne the loue, or
by courage erected the hopes of all men: yea of
many who had bin his greatest enemies. With
these also the <i>Emperour Henry</i> 4. sent him certaine
troupes of Souldiers, commanded by a
Prince of <i>Almaine</i>. Hee receiued also many
promises of fauour from <i>Swaine</i> King of <i>Denmarke</i>.
And who can assure (for the sequele
maketh the coniecture probable) that he held
not intelligence with <i>Harold Harfager</i> King of
<i>Norway</i>, to inuade <i>England</i> with two armies at
once. So partly by his owne Subiects, and partly
by supply from his Alleys and friends, hee amassed
a strong Armie, consisting chiefly of
<i>Normans</i>, <i>Flemings</i>, <i>French</i> and <i>Britaines</i>, to the
number of fiftie thousand men; and brought
them to S. <i>Valeries</i>, before which Towne his
ships did ride. Here he stayed a certaine time
attending the wind, as most writers doe report;
but rather as it may be coniectured, to awaite
the arriuall of <i>Harold Harfager</i> K. of <i>Norway</i>:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
knowing right well, that the inuasion of <i>Harold</i>
of <i>Norway</i> vpon the North parts of the realme,
would draw away <i>Harold</i> of <i>England</i> to leaue
the coasts towards the South vndefended.</p>

<p>During his abode at S. <i>Valeries</i>, certaine English
espials were taken, whom King <i>Harold</i>
had sent to discouer both the purposes and
power of the Duke. When they were brought
to his presence, with a braue confidence he said
vnto them: <i>Your Lord might well haue spared this
charge; hee needed not to haue cast away his cost to
vnderstand that by your industrie and faith, which
my owne presence shall manifest vnto him; more
certainly, more shortly then he doth expect. Goe
your wayes, goe tell him from me, If he find me not
before the end of this yeere, in the place where hee
supposeth that hee may most safely set his foote, let
him neuer feare danger from mee whilest hee liue.</i>
Many <i>Normans</i> disliked this open dealing of
the Duke: preferring to his iudgement the valour
and experience of King <i>Harold</i>; the greatnesse
of his treasure; the number and goodnes
of his men; but especially his strong Nauie,
and expert Saylers; accustomed both to the
fights and dangers of the Sea, more then any
other people in the world. To these the Duke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
turned, and sayd: <i>I am glad to heare this opinion
run, both of his prowesse and of his power; the greater
shall our glory bee in preuailing against him.
But I see right well that I haue small cause to
feare his discouery of our strength, when you,
who are so neere vnto mee, discerne so little. Rest
your selues vpon the Iustice of your cause
and foresight of your Commaunder. Who hath
lesse then hee, who can iustly tearme nothing his
owne? I know more of his weakenesse, then euer he
shall know of my strength, vntill he feele it. Performe
you your parts like men, and he shall neuer be
able to disappoint either my assurance, or your
hopes.</i></p>

<p>Now <i>Harold</i> King of <i>England</i> had prepared
a fleet to resist the inuasion of the duke of <i>Normandie</i>:
but by reason of his long stay at S. <i>Valeries</i>,
speeches did spread, whether by error or
subornation, yea, assured aduertisement was
sent out of <i>Flanders</i>, that he had for that yeere
abandoned his enterprise. In the meane time
<i>Harold Harfager</i> King of <i>Norway</i>, then whom
no man was esteemed more valiant, hauing assured
both intelligence and aide out of <i>England</i>,
arriued in the mouth of <i>Humber</i>: and
from thence drawing vp against the streame of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
the riuer <i>Owse</i>, landed at a place called <i>Richhall</i>.
Here he Marshalled his Armie, and marched
foorth into the Countrey: and when hee came
neere vnto <i>Yorke</i>, he was encountred by the
<i>English</i>, led by <i>Edwine</i> and <i>Morchar</i> the principall
commanders of all those quarters. The
fight was furious, but in the end the <i>English</i>
were ouerthrowne, and with a great slaughter
chased into <i>Yorke</i>.</p>

<p>Vpon aduertisement hereof, <i>Harold</i> King
of <i>England</i> caried all his forces against <i>Harfager</i>.
His readinesse was such, and such his expedition,
that the fifth day after the fight before
mentioned he gaue him battell againe; wherein
<i>Harold Harfager</i> was slaine, and so was <i>Tosto</i>
the King of <i>Englands</i> brother: <i>Tosto</i> by an vncertaine
enemie, but <i>Harfager</i> by the hand of
<i>Harold</i> of <i>England</i>. Their armie also was routed,
and with a bloody execution pursued, so long
as day and furie did last. Here a certaine Souldier
of <i>Norway</i> was most famous almost for a
miracle of manhood. He had been appointed
with certaine others, to guard the passage at
<i>Stamford</i> bridge. The residue vpon approach
of the English forsooke their charge; but hee
alone stepped to the foote of the Bridge, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
with his Battle-axe sustained the shocke of the
whole armie; slew aboue fourty assailants, and
defended both the passage and himselfe, vntill
an English Souldier went vnder the Bridge,
and through a hole thereof thrust him into
the bodie with a Launce.</p>

<p>If this victory of King <i>Harold</i> had been so
wisely vsed as it was valiantly wonne, he should
haue neglected the spoyle, and returned with
the like celeritie wherewith he came. But hee
gaue discontentment to his Souldiers, in abridging
their expectation for free sharing the
spoile; and hauing lost many in that conflict,
he retired to <i>Yorke</i>, and there stayed; as well to
reforme the state of the Countrey, greatly disordered
by meanes of these warres, as also both
to refresh and repaire his armie.</p>

<p>In the meane time the Duke of <i>Normandie</i>
receiuing intelligence, that the Sea-coasts were
left naked of defence, loosed from S. <i>Valeries</i>
with three hundred, or, as some writers report,
896, or, as one <i>Norman</i> writer affirmes, with
more then one thousand saile: and hauing a
gentle gale, arriued at <i>Pemsey</i> in <i>Sussex</i>, vpon
the 28. of September. The ship wherein the
Duke was caried is said, (as if it had runne for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
the garland of victory) to haue outstripped the
rest so farre, that the sailers were enforced to
strike saile, and hull before the winde to haue
their companie. When hee first stepped vpon
the shoare, one of his feete slipped a little. The
Duke to recouer himselfe stepped more strongly
with the other foote, and sunke into the
sand somewhat deepe. One of his Souldiers
espying this, sayd merrily vnto him: <i>You had
almost fallen my Lord, but you haue well maintained
your standing, and haue now taken deepe and
firme footing in the soyle of</i> England. <i>The presage
is good, and hereupon I salute you King.</i> The Duke
laughed; and the souldiers, with whom superstition
doth strongly worke, were much confirmed
in courage by the ieast.</p>

<p>When he had landed his forces, he fortified
a piece of ground with strong trenches, and
discharged all his ships; leauing to his souldiers
no hope to saue themselues, but by onely by
victory. After this he published the causes of
his comming in armes, namely:</p>

<p>1 To chalenge the kingdome of <i>England</i>,
giuen to him by his cousin King <i>Edward</i>, the
last lawfull possessor at that time thereof.</p>

<p>2 To reuenge the death of his cousin <i>Alfred</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
brother to the same K. <i>Edward</i>, and of the <i>Normans</i>,
who did accompanie him into <i>England</i>;
no lesse cruelly then deceitfully slaine by Earle
<i>Goodwin</i> and his adherents.</p>

<p>3 To reuenge the iniurie done vnto <i>Robert</i>
Archbishop of Canterburie; who by the
practise (as it was then giuen foorth) of <i>Harold</i>,
had been exiled in the life time of King
<i>Edward</i>.</p>

<p>This last article was added either to please
the Pope, or generally in fauour of the Cleargie:
to whom the example grew then intollerable,
that an Archbishop should bee once questioned
by any other then by themselues.</p>

<p>So the Duke, leauing his fortification furnished
with competent forces to assure the
place, as wel for a retreit, as for daily landing of
fresh supplies, marched forward to <i>Hastings</i>;
and there raised another fortresse, and planted
likewise a garison therein. And in all places he
restrained his Souldiers, either from spoyling
or harming the Countrey people, for feare that
thereby they would fall into disorder: but giuing
forth, that it were crueltie to spoile them,
who in short time should be his Subiects. Here
the Duke, because he would not either aduen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>ture
or trust his Souldiers, went foorth in person
to discouer the Countrey, with 15. horsemen
in his company, and no more. His returne
was on foote, by reason of the euill qualitied
wayes: and when <i>Fitz-Osberne</i> who went with
him, was ouerwearied with the weight of his armour,
the Duke eased him by bearing his helmet
vpon his shoulder. This action may seeme
of slender regard; but yet did gaine him, both
fauour and dutie among his Souldiers.</p>

<p>K. <i>Harold</i> hearing of these approches, hasted
by great iourneyes towards <i>London</i>; sending
his messengers to all places, both to encourage
and entreate the people to draw together
for their common defence. Here he mustered
his Souldiers; and albeit hee found that
his forces were much impaired by his late battaile
against <i>Harfager</i>, yet he gathered an able
armie, countenanced and commanded by diuers
of the Nobilitie, which resorted vnto him
from many parts of the Realme. The Duke in
the meane time sent a messenger vnto him,
who demanded the Kingdome in so stout maner,
that he was at the point to haue bene euill
entreated by the King. Againe the King sent
his messenger to the Duke, forbidding him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
with loftie language, to make any stay within
that Countrey; but to returne againe no lesse
speedily, then rashly he had entred. The Duke
betweene mirth and scorne returned answere;
That as he came not vpon his entreaty, so at his
command he would not depart. But (said he)
<i>I am not come to word with your King, I am come
to fight, and am desirous to fight: I will be ready to
fight with him, albeit I had but 10000. such men
as I haue brought 60000.</i></p>

<p>K. <i>Harold</i> spent little time, lost none (vnlesse
happely that which hee might haue taken
more) both in appointing and ordering his Armie.
And when he was ready to take the field,
his mother entreated him, first moderately,
then with words of passion and with teares,
that he would not aduenture his person to the
battaile. Her importunitie was admired the
more, for that it was both without any apparant
cause, and not vsuall in former times. But
<i>Harold</i> with vndaunted countenance and
heart, conducted his Armie into <i>Sussex</i>, and
encamped within seuen miles of the <i>Normans</i>:
who thereupon approched so neere to the
<i>English</i>, that the one Armie was within view of
the other.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span></p>

<p>First, espials were sent on both sides, to discouer
the state and condition of their enemies.
They who were sent from the English made a
large report, both of the number, and appointment,
and discipline of the <i>Normans</i>. Whereupon
<i>Girth</i>, yonger brother to King <i>Harold</i>
presented him with aduise, not to play his
whole State at a cast; not to bee so caried with
desire of victory, as not to awaite the time to
attaine it: that it is proper to Inuaders presently
to fight, because they are then in the very pride
and flourish of their strength; but the assailed
should rather delay battell, rather obserue only
and attend their enemies, cut off their reliefe,
vexe them with incommodities, weary them,
and weare them out by degrees: that it could
not be long before the Dukes armie, being in
a strange Countrey, would be reduced to necessities;
it could not bee long but by reason it
consisted of diuers nations, it would draw into
disorder: that it was proper to an armie compounded
of different people, to be almost inuincible
at the first, whilest all contend to excell
or at least to equal other in braue performance;
but if they be aduisedly endured, they will easily
fall into disorders, and lastly of themselues<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
dissolue. <i>Or if</i> (sayd he) <i>you resolue to fight, yet
because you are sworne to the Duke, you shall doe
well to withdraw your presence; to imploy your
authoritie in mustering a new armie, to bee readie
to receiue him with fresh forces. And if you
please to commit the charge of this incounter vnto
me, I will not faile to expresse, both the loue of a
brother, and the care and courage of a Commander.
For as I am not obliged to the Duke by oath, so shall
I either preuaile with the better cause, or with the
quieter conscience die.</i></p>

<p>Both these counsailes were reiected by <i>Harold</i>:
The first out of a violent vehemencie of
these Northerne nations, who doe commonly
esteeme delay of battell a deiected cowardise, a
base and seruile deflouring of time; but to beare
through their designes at once, they account a
point of honourable courage. The second he
esteemed both shamefull to his reputation,
and hurtfull to the state of his affaires. For
what honour had he gained by his former victories,
if when he came to the greatest pinch of
danger, hee should fearefully shrinke backe?
with what heart should the Souldiers fight,
when they haue not his presence for whom
they fight? when they haue not their Generall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
an eye witnesse of their performance? when
they want his sight, his encouragement, his example
to enflame them to valour? The presence
of the Prince is worth many thousands of
ordinarie Souldiers: The ordinary Souldier wil
vndertake both labour and danger for no other
respects so much, as by the presence of the
Prince. And therefore he did greatly extenuate
the worth of the <i>Normans</i>, terming them a
company of Priests; because their fashion was
to shaue their faces: But whatsoeuer they were,
as he had (hee said) digested in his minde the
hardest euents of battell; so either the infamie
or suspicion of cowardise in no case hee would
incurre. Hee resolued not to ouerliue so great
dishonour; he resolued to set vp as his last rest,
his Crowne, and Kingdome; and life withall.
And thus oftentimes Fortune dealeth with
men, as Executioners doe with condemned
persons; she will first blindfold, and then dispatch
them.</p>

<p>After this the <i>Norman</i> sent a Monke to offer
the choise of these conditions to <i>Harold</i>; Either
to relinquish his kingdome vpon certaine conditions;
or to hold it vnder homage to the
Duke; or to try their cause by single combate;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
or to submit it to the iudgement of the Pope,
according to the Lawes of <i>Normandy</i> or of <i>England</i>,
which he would. Againe, some conditions
were propounded from K. <i>Harold</i> to the
Duke: But their thoughts were so lifted vp
both with pride and confidence, by reason of
their former victories, that no moderate ouerture
could take place: and so they appointed
the day following, which was the 14. of October,
to determine their quarrell by sentence of
the sword. This happened to be the birth day
of K. <i>Harold</i>, which for that cause by a superstitious
errour, he coniectured would be prosperous
vnto him.</p>

<p>The night before the battaile for diuers respects
was vnquiet. The <i>English</i> spent the time
in feasting and drinking, and made the aire
ring with showtings and songs: the <i>Normans</i>
were more soberly silent, and busied themselues
much in deuotion; being rather still
then quiet, not so much watchful as not able to
sleepe. At the first appearance of the day, the
King and the Duke were ready in Armes, encouraging
their Souldiers, and ordering them
in their arrayes; in whose eyes it seemed that
courage did sparckle, and that in their face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
and gesture victorie did sit. The Duke put
certaine reliques about his necke, vpon which
King <i>Harold</i> had sworne vnto him. It is reported
that when he armed, the backe of his
Curasses was placed before by errour of him
that put it on: some would haue bin dismayed
hereat, but the Duke smiled, and said; Assuredly
this day my Fortune will turne, I shall either
be a King, or nothing before night.</p>

<p>The <i>English</i> were knit in one maine body
on foot; whereof the first rancks consisted of
<i>Kentishmen</i> (who by an ancient custome did
challenge the honour of that place,) the next
were filled with <i>Londoners</i>; then followed the
other <i>English</i>. Their chiefe weapons were
pole-axe, sword and dart, with a large target for
their defence. They were paled in front with
paueises in such wise, that it was thought impossible
for the enemie to breake them. The
King stood on foot by his Standard, with two
of his brothers, <i>Girth</i> and <i>Leofwine</i>; as well to
relieue from thence all parts that should happen
to be distressed, as also to manifest to the
Souldiers, that they reteined no thought of escaping
by flight. On the other side, the <i>Normans</i>
were diuided into three battailes: The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
first was conducted by <i>Roger Montgomerie</i>, and
<i>William Fitz-Osborne</i>; it consisted of horsemen
of <i>Aniou</i>, <i>Maine</i> and <i>Britaine</i>, commanded
by a <i>Britaine</i> named <i>Fergent</i>; It caried the
Banner which the Pope had sent. The middle
battaile consisting of Souldiers out of <i>Germanie</i>
and <i>Poictou</i>, was led by <i>Geoffrye Martell</i>, and a
Prince of <i>Almaine</i>. The Duke himselfe closed
the last battaile, with the strength of his
<i>Normans</i> and the flowre of his Nobilitie. The
Archers were diuided into wings, and also dispersed
by bands through all the three battails.</p>

<p>Thus were both sides set vpon a bloody bargaine;
ambition, hope, anger, hate, enflaming
them to valour. The duke edged his Souldiers,
by declaring vnto them the noble Acts of their
ancesters, the late admirable atchieuement of
their fellow <i>Normans</i> in subduing the Kingdome
of <i>Sicill</i>, their owne braue exploits vnder
him; by shewing them all that pleasant and
plentifull Countrey, as the purchase of their
prowesse, as the gaine and reward of their aduenture:
by putting them in minde, that they
were in a Countrey both hostile &amp; vnknowne,
before them the sword, the vast Ocean behind,
no place of retreit, no surety but in valour and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
in victory; so as they who would not contend
for glory, were vpon necessitie to fight for their
liues: Lastly, by assuring them, that as he was
the first in aduise, so would he be the foremost
in aduenture, being fully resolued either to vanquish,
or to die. The King encouraged his
men, by presenting to their remembrance, the
miseries which they susteined not long before,
vnder the oppression of the <i>Danes</i>; which whether
they were againe to endure, or neuer to
feare, it lieth (said he) in the issue of this field.
The King had the aduantage both for number
of men, and for their large able bodies; The
Duke both in Armes, (especially in regard of
the Bow and arrowes,) and in experience and
skill of Armes; both equall in courage; both
confident alike in the fauour of Fortune, which
had alwayes crowned their courage with victory.
And now by affronting of both the Armies,
the plots and labours of many moneths,
were reduced to the hazard of a few houres.</p>

<p>The <i>Normans</i> marched with a song of the
valiant acts of <i>Rowland</i>, esteeming nothing of
perill in regard of the glory of their aduenture.
When they approched neere their enemies,
they saluted them first with a storme of Ar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>rowes:
<i>Robert Fitz Beaumonte</i> a yong Gentleman
of <i>Normandie</i>, beginning the fight from
the right Wing. This maner of fight as it was
new, so was it most terrible to the <i>English</i>, so
were they least prouided to auoyd it. First,
they opened their rancks, to make way for the
Arrowes to fall; but when that auoydance did
nothing auaile, they cloased againe, and couered
themselues with their Targets, ioyned together
in maner of a pendhouse; encouraging
one another, to hast forward, to leape lustily to
hand-strokes, and to scoure their swords in the
entrailes of their enemies. Then the Duke
commanded his horsemen to charge: but the
<i>English</i> receiued them vpon the points of their
weapons, with so liuely courage, in so firme
and stiffe order, that the ouerthrow of many of
the foremost, did teach their followers to aduenture
themselues with better aduise. Hereupon
they shifted into wings, and made way
for the footmen to come forward. Then did
both armies ioyne in a horrible shocke, with
Pole-axes, &amp; the Prince of weapons the sword:
maintaining the fight with so manlike furie,
as if it had bene a battaile of Giants, rather then
of men. And so they continued the greatest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
part of that day, in close and furious fight;
blow for blow, wound for wound, death for
death; their feet steadie, their hands diligent,
their eyes watchfull, their hearts resolute; neither
their aduisement dazeled by fiercenesse,
nor their fiercenesse any thing abated by aduisement.</p>

<p>In the meane time the horsemen gaue many
sharpe charges, but were alwayes beaten backe
with disaduantage. The greatest annoyance
came from the Archers; whose shot showred
among the <i>English</i> so thicke, as they seemed to
haue the enemy in the middest of their Armie.
Their armour was not sufficiently either compleate
or of proofe to defend them, but euery
hand, euery finger breadth vnarmed, was almost
an assured place for a deepe, and many
times a deadly wound. Thus whilest the front
was maintained in good condition, many
thousands were beaten downe behind; whose
death was not so grieuous vnto them, as the
maner of their death, in the middest of their
friends, without an enemie at hand, vpon
whom they might shew some valour, and
worke some reuenge.</p>

<p>This maner of fight would soone haue de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>termined
aswell the hopes as the feares of both
sides, had not the targets of English been very
seruiceable vnto them; Had not King <i>Harold</i>
also with a liuely and constant resolution, performed
the part, not onely of a skilfull commander,
by directing, encouraging, prouiding,
relieuing; but of a valiant Souldier by vsing his
weapon, to the excellent example of his Souldiers. In
places of greatest danger hee was alwayes present;
repayring the decayes, reforming the disorders,
and encouraging his company, that in
doing as men, whether they preuailed, or whether
they perished, their labour was alwayes
gloriously employed. So they knit strongly
together, and stood in close and thicke array,
as if they had been but one body: not onely
bearing the brunt of their enemies, but making
such an impression vpon their squadron, that
the great bodie began to shake. The Duke aduentured
in person so farre, moued no lesse by
his naturall magnanimitie, then by glory of the
enterprise, that besides his often alighting to
fight on foote, two, or (as some report) three
horses were slaine vnder him. And hauing a
body both able by nature, and by vse hardened
to endure trauaile, hee exacted the greater ser<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>uice
of his Souldiers: commending the forward,
blaming the slow, and crying out (according
to his nature) with vehement gesture
and voice vnto all; that it was a shame
for them who had been victorious against all
men with whom they dealt, to be so long held
by the <i>English</i> in delay of victory. So partly by
his authoritie, and partly by his example, he retained
his Souldiers, and imposed vpon them
the fayrest necessitie of courage; whilest euery
man contended to win a good opinion of their
Prince.</p>

<p>Then the fight entred into a new fitte of
heate; nothing lesse feared then death, the
greatnesse of danger making both sides the
more resolute: and they who could not approach
to strike with the hand, were heard to
encourage their fellowes by speach, to pursue
the victory, to pursue their glory, not to turne
to their owne both destruction and disgrace.
The clashing of armour, the iustling of bodies,
the resounding of blowes, was the fairest part
of this bloody medley: but the grislinesse of
wounds, the hideous fals and groanes of the
dying, all the field defiled with dust, blood, broken
armour, mangled bodies, represented Ter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>rour
in her foulest forme. Neuer was furie better
gouerned; neuer game of death better
played. The more they fought the better they
fought; the more they smarted, the lesse they
regarded smart.</p>

<p>At the last, when the Duke perceiued that
the <i>English</i> could not be broken by strength of
arme, he gaue direction that his men should retire
and giue ground; not loosely, not disorderly,
as in a fearefull and confused haste, but aduisedly
and for aduantage; keeping the front
of their squadron firme and close, without disbanding
one foote in array. Nothing was
more hurtfull to the <i>English</i>, being of a franke
and noble spirit, then that their violent inclination
caried them too fast into hope of victory.
For, feeling their enemies to yeeld vnder their
hand, they did rashly follow those who were
not hasty to flee: And in the heate of their
pursuit, vpon a false conceit of victory, loosed
and disordered their rankes, thinking then of
nothing but of executing the chase. The <i>Normans</i>
espying the aduantage to be ripe, made a
stiffe stand, redoubled vpon the <i>English</i>, and
pressing on with a furie equall to their fauourable
fortune, with a cruell butchery brake into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
them. On the other side it is scarce credible
with what strength both of courage and hand
the <i>English</i> euen in despight of death, sustained
themselues in this disorder; drawing into small
squadrons, and beating downe their enemies
on euery hand, being resolued to sell their
liues with their place.</p>

<p>But a mischiefe is no mischiefe, if it comes
alone. Besides this disaduantage of disarray,
the shot of the <i>Normans</i>, did continually beate
vpon the <i>English</i> with a grieuous execution.
Among other King <i>Harold</i> about the closing
of the euening, as he was busie in sustaining his
armie, both with voyce and with hand, was
strooke with an arrow through the left eye into
his braines, of which wound hee presently
died. His two brothers, <i>Girth</i> and <i>Leofwine</i>
were also slaine, and also most of the nobilitie
that were present: So long as the King stood,
they stood stoutly, both with him, and for him,
and by him: his directions supported them, his
braue behauiour breathed fresh boldnesse and
life into them. But his death was a deadly
stabbe to their courage; vpon report of his
death, they began to wauer in resolution, whether
to trust to the force of their armes, or to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
commend their safetie to their good footemanship.
In this incertainty many were slaine:
Many retired in reasonable order to a rising
ground, whither they were closely followed
by the <i>Normans</i>; but the <i>English</i> hauing gotten
aduantage of the place, and drawing courage
out of despaire, with a bloody charge did
driue them downe. Count <i>Eustachius</i> supposing
fresh forces to be arriued, fled away with
fiftie Souldiers in his company; and meeting
with the Duke, rounded him secretly in his
eare, that if hee went any further hee was vndone.
Whilest he was thus speaking, hee was
strooke betweene the shoulder with so violent
a blowe, that he fell downe as dead, and voided
much blood at his nose and mouth. In this conflict
many of the noblest <i>Normans</i> were slaine,
which mooued the Duke to make a strong
ordered stand, giuing libertie therby for those
<i>English</i> to retire. Others fled through a watery
channell, the passages whereof were well
knowen vnto them: and when the <i>Normans</i>
did more sharpely then aduisedly pursue, the
place being shadowed partly with Sedges and
Reedes, and partly with the night, they were
either stifled in the waters, or easily destroyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
by the <i>English</i>, and that in so great numbers,
that the place was filled vp with dead bodies.
The residue scattered in smaller companies,
and had their flight fauoured by increasing
darkenesse: the enemie not aduenturing to
follow, both in a strange Countrey, and in the
night. Earle <i>Edwine</i> and Earle <i>Morchar</i>, brothers
of approoued both courage and faith, did
great seruice at that time, in collecting these
dispersed Troupes, and leading them in some
fashion to <i>London</i>.</p>

<p>Duke <i>William</i> surprised with Ioy, gaue publike
charge for a solemne thanksgiuing to God.
Then he erected his pauilion in the middest of
the field, among the thickest of those bodies
whom death had made to lie quietly together.
There he passed the residue of that night; and
the next morning mustered his souldiers, buried
those that were slaine, and gaue libertie to
the <i>English</i> to do the like. The bodie of King
<i>Harold</i> could not be knowen by his face, it was
so deformed by death, and by his wound; by
his armour and by certaine markes vpon his
body it was knowen. As it lay vpon the ground,
a <i>Norman</i> Souldier did strike it into the legge
with his sword: for which vnmanly acte he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
cassed by the Duke with open disgrace. It was
caried into the Dukes Pauilion, vnder the custodie
of <i>William Mallet</i>. And when his mother
made suite for it to bee buried, the Duke
denied it at the first; affirming, that buriall was
not fit for him, whose ambition was the cause of
so many Funerals. The mother, besides her
lamentations and teares, offered for it (as one
<i>Norman</i> writer affirmes) the weight thereof in
gold. But the Duke, with a manly compassion
gaue it freely; as holding it dishonourable both
to value the bodie of a King, and make sale of a
slaine enemie. So his body was buried by his
mother at <i>Waltham Crosse</i> within the monasterie
which hee had founded. Verely there was
nothing to be blamed in him, but that his courage
could not stoupe to be lower then a King.</p>

<p>I haue been the more long in describing this
battel, for that I esteem it the most memorable
and best executed that euer was fought within
this land: as well for skilfull direction, as for
couragious performance, and also for the greatnesse
of the euent. The fight continued with
very great both constancie of courage, and variety
of fortune, from seuen of the clocke in the
morning vntill night. Of the <i>Normans</i> were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
slaine 6000 and more, besides those that were
drowned and beaten downe in the water. The
slaughter of the <i>English</i> is vncertainely reported,
but certainely it was farre greater then that
of the <i>Normans</i>. Certaine also that their death
was most honourable and faire, not any one
basely abandoning the fielde; not any one
yeelding to bee taken prisoner. And yet one
circumstance more I hold fit to bee obserued;
that this victory was gotten onely by the
meanes of the bow and arrow: The vse
whereof was by the <i>Normans</i> first brought into
this land. Afterward the <i>English</i> being
trained to that fight, did thereby chiefly maintaine
themselues with honourable aduantage,
against all nations with whom they did contend
in armes; being generally reputed the best
shot in the world.</p>

<p>But of late yeeres it hath bene altogether
layed aside, and in stead thereof the harquebuze
and calliuer are brought into vse: yet not
without contradiction of many expert men of
Armes; who albeit they doe not reiect the vse
of these small pieces, yet doe they preferre the
Bow before them. First, for that in a reasonable
distance, it is of greater both certainty and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
force. Secondly, for that it dischargeth faster.
Thirdly, for that more men may discharge
therewith at once: for onely the first rancke
dischargeth the piece, neither hurt they any
but those that are in front; but with the bow
10. or 12. rancks may discharge together, and
will annoy so many ranckes of the enemies.
Lastly, for that the arrow doeth strike more
parts of the body: for in that it hurteth by discent;
(and not onely point blancke like the
bullet) there is no part of the body but it may
strike; from the crowne of the head, euen to
the nayling of the foot to the ground. Hereupon
it followeth, that the arrowes falling so
thicke as haile vpon the bodies of men, as lesse
fearefull of their flesh, so more slenderly armed
then in former times, must necessarily worke
most dangerous effects.</p>

<p>Besides these generall respects in many particular
seruices and times, the vse of the Bow is
of greatest aduantage. If some defence lye before
the enemy, the arrow may strike where the
bullet cannot. Foule weather may much hinder
the discharge of the piece, but it is no great
impediment to the shot of the Bow. A horse
strooke with a bullet if the wound be not mor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>tall,
may performe good seruice; but if an arrow
be fastened in his flesh, the continuall
stirring thereof, occasioned by the motion of
himselfe, will enforce him to cast off all command,
and either beare downe or disorder
those that are neere.</p>

<p>But the cracke of the piece (will some man
say) doeth strike a terrour into the enemie.
True, if they bee such as neuer heard the like
noise before. But a little vse wil extinguish these
terrours: to men, yea to beasts acquainted with
these cracks, they worke a weake impression of
feare. And if it be true which all men of action
doe hold, that the eye in all battailes is first ouercome,
then against men equally accustomed
to both, the sight of the arrow is more auaileable
to victorie then the cracke of the
piece. Assuredly, the Duke before the battaile
encouraged his men, for that they should
deale with enemies who had no shot. But I
will leaue this point to be determined by more
discerning iudgements, and happily by further
experience in these affaires, and returne againe
to my principall purpose.</p>

<p>The next day after the victorie the Duke returned
to <i>Hastings</i>, about seuen miles from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
place of the encounter, partly to refresh his Armie,
and partly to settle in aduise and order
for his further prosecution. First, he dispatched
messengers to signifie his successe to his friends
abroad; to the Pope he sent King <i>Harolds</i> Standerd,
which represented a man fighting,
wrought curiously with golde and precious
stones. Afterwards placing a strong garrison
at <i>Hastings</i>, he conducted his Armie towards
<i>London</i>: not the direct way, but coasted about
through part of <i>Kent</i>, through <i>Sussex</i>, <i>Surrey</i>,
<i>Hampshire</i> and <i>Barkeshire</i>: the wayes where
hee passed being as free from resistance, as his
thoughts were from change. At <i>Wallingford</i>
he passed ouer the <i>Thames</i>; and then marched
forward through <i>Oxford-shire</i>, <i>Buckingham-shire</i>,
and <i>Hartford-shire</i>, vntill he came to the
Castle at <i>Berkhamstead</i>. In this passage many
of his Souldiers languished and died of the
Fluxe. And whether it were vpon licentiousnesse
after the late victorie, or whether for want
of necessary prouision, or whether to strike a
terrour into the <i>English</i>, or whether to leaue no
danger at his backe, he permitted the sword to
range at large, to harrie freely, to defile many
places with ruine and blood.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span></p>

<p>In the meane time the <i>English</i> Lords assembled
at <i>London</i>, to aduise vpon their common
affaires; but the varietie of opinions was the
chiefe impediment to the present seruice; the
danger being more important, then the counsaile
resolute, or the confidence assured. The
Nobilitie enclined to declare <i>Edgar</i> grandchild
to <i>Edmund Ironside</i>, to be their King: and
with these the <i>Londoners</i> wholy went. But
those of the Clergie were of opinion (some
vpon particular respects, all vpon feare to displease
the Pope) to yeeld to the storme and
streame of the present time, to yeeld to the
mightie Arme of <span class="f"><span class="smcap">God</span></span>; that their forces being
prostrated, their hopes feeble and forlorne,
they must be content not to be constrained;
they must not prouoke the Victor too farre; against
whose forces and felicities, time gaue
them not power to oppose. This deliberation
held so long, that all the time of action was
spent. For the Duke approched so neere the
Citie, that many preferring their safetie before
other respects, withdrew themselues and went
vnto him. Hereupon the residue dissolued:
and <i>Alfred</i> Archb. of <i>Yorke</i>, <i>Wolstane</i> Bishop of
<i>Worcester</i>, <i>Wilfire</i> B. of <i>Hereford</i>, and many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
other Prelates of the Realme went vnto the
Duke at <i>Berkhamstead</i>; accompanied with <i>Edgar</i>,
Earle <i>Edwine</i>, Earle <i>Morchar</i>, and diuers
others of the Nobilitie: who gaue pledges for
their allegiance, and were thereupon receiued
to subiection and fauour. The Duke presently
dispatched to <i>London</i>, was receiued with many
declarations of ioy, the lesser in heart, the
fairer in appearance, and vpon <i>Christmas day</i>
next following was crowned King.</p>

<p>Now the meanes whereby this victory was<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
assured, were the very same whereby it was atchieued;
euen by a stiffe and rigorous hand.
For whosoeuer supposeth that a State atteined
by force, can be reteined by milder meanes, he
shall find himselfe disappointed of his hopes. A
people newly subdued by force, will so long remaine
in obedience, as they finde themselues
not of force to resist.</p>

<p>And first he endeauoured either to preuent
or appease all forren warres, especially against
the <i>Danes</i>, who were then chiefly feared in
<i>England</i>, as well in regard of their former victories,
as for that they pretended title to the
Crowne. And herein two things did especially
fauour his affaires. One, for that the <i>Normans</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
were in some sort allied to the <i>Danes</i>; being
the progenie of those <i>Noruegians</i> and
<i>Danes</i>, which vnder the conduct and fortune
of <i>Rollo</i> inuaded <i>France</i>, &amp; after many great
atchieuements, seated in <i>Normandie</i>. The other
was, for that after the death of <i>Canutus</i>, the
state of <i>Denmarke</i> was much infeebled by diuision.
For the <i>Noruegians</i> set vp <i>Magnus</i> the
sonne of <i>Olaus</i> for their King; but the <i>Danes</i>
acknowledged <i>Canutus</i> the third of that name:
by meanes whereof that puissant empire did
languish in consumption of it selfe, and could
not be dangerous to any neighbour Countrey.
Yet ceased they not for many yeeres, to continue
claime to the Crowne of <i>England</i>: But
King <i>William</i> had purchased many sure and secret
friends in that diseased state, wherein all
publike affaires were set to sale; especially he vsed
the authoritie of <i>Adelbert</i>, Archbishop of
<i>Hamburgh</i>, either to crosse all counsaile of hostilitie
against him, or else to delay, and thereby
to delude the enterprise, or lastly so to manage
the action, that it should not worke any
dangerous effect.</p>

<p>After the death of <i>Swaine</i>, <i>Canutus</i> prepared
a Nauie of one thousand saile for inuasion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
of <i>England</i>; and was aided with sixe hundred
more by <i>Robert le Frizon</i>, whose daughter hee
had taken to wife. But either for want, or else
by negligence, or happily of purpose, this
Nauie continued, partly in preparation, and
partly in a readinesse, the space of two yeeres,
and then the voyage was layd aside. The cause
was attributed to contrarietie of winds; but the
contrariety of wils was the truest impediment.
Likewise <i>Swaine</i> had furnished against <i>England</i>
a Nauie of 200. sayle, commanded by
Earle <i>Osborne</i> his brother. Another fleete of
200. saile was set foorth vnder the charge of
Earle <i>Hacon</i>: But King <i>William</i> so corrupted
them both, that the one departed out of the
Realme without performing any great exploit,
the other neuer would arriue.</p>

<p>Also out of these confusions in <i>England</i>,
<i>Malcolme</i> King of Scots, did take his opportunitie
for action. Hee receiued into protection
many <i>English</i>, who either for feare, or for discontentment,
forsooke their Countrey; of
whom many families in <i>Scotland</i> are descended,
and namely these; <i>Lindsey</i>, <i>Vaus</i>, <i>Ramsey</i>,
<i>Louell</i>, <i>Towbris</i>, <i>Sandlands</i>, <i>Bissart</i>, <i>Sowlis</i>,
<i>Wardlaw</i>, <i>Maxwell</i>, with diuers others. Hee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
entertained into his Court <i>Edgar Atheling</i>; and
tooke his sister <i>Margaret</i> to wife. He possessed
himselfe of a great part of <i>Cumberland</i>, and of
<i>Northumberland</i>; wherewith the people were
well content, for that hee was their Earles sisters
sonne.</p>

<p>Hereupon King <i>William</i> sent against him,
first, <i>Roger</i> a <i>Norman</i>, who was traiterously
slaine by his owne Souldiers, then <i>Gospatrick</i>,
Earle of <i>Gloucester</i>: These did onely represse
the enemie, but were not able to finish the
warre fully. Lastly, hee went himselfe with a
mighty armie into <i>Scotland</i>, where hee made
wide waste, and in <i>Lothiam</i> found King <i>Malcolme</i>,
prepared both in force and resolution to
entertaine him with battell. The great armie
of King <i>William</i>, their faire furniture and order,
their sudden comming, but especially their
firme countenance and readinesse to fight,
much daunted the <i>Scots</i>: whereupon King
<i>Malcolme</i> sent a Herault to King <i>William</i>, to
mooue him to some agreement of peace. The
more that the King was pleased herewith, the
more hee seemed vnwilling and strange: the
more he must be perswaded to that, which if it
had not bin offered, he would haue desired. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
the last, a peace was concluded, vpon conditions
honourable for King <i>William</i>, and not vnreasonable
for the King of <i>Scots</i>: whereby all
the <i>English</i> were pardoned, who had fled into
<i>Scotland</i>, and borne armes against their King.</p>

<p>As for the <i>Welsh</i>, albeit both their courage
and their power had been extreamely broken
in the time of King <i>Edward</i>, and that by the
valour and industry of <i>Harold</i>; yet vpon aduantage
of these troubled times, they made
some incursions into the borders of <i>England</i>;
but in companies so disordered and small, so secretly
assaulting, so suddenly retiring, so desirous
more of pillage then of blood, that they
seemed more like to ordinarie robbers then to
enemies in field. Against these the King ledde
an armie into <i>Wales</i>, reduced the people both
to subiection and quiet, made all the principall
men tributary vnto him, receiued pledges of
all, for assurance of their obedience and faith.</p>

<p>Whilest the King thus setled his affaires abroad,
he secured himselfe against his subiects,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
not by altering their will, but by taking away
their power to rebell. The stoutest of the Nobilitie
and Gentlemen were spent, either by
warre, or by banishment, or by voluntary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
auoidance out of the Realme. All these hee
stripped of their states, and in place of them
aduanced his <i>Normans</i>: insomuch as scarce any
noble family of the <i>English</i> blood did beare
either office or authoritie within the Realme.
And these ranne headlong to seruitude; the
more hasty and with the fairer shew, the more
either countenanced or safe. These he did assure
vnto him, not onely by oath of fidelitie
and homage, but either by pledges, or else by
reteining them alwaies by his side.</p>

<p>And because at that time the Clergie were
the principall strings of the <i>English</i> strength, he
permitted not any of the <i>English</i> Nation to be
aduanced to the dignities of the Church, but
furnished them with <i>Normans</i>, and other
strangers. And whereas in times before, the
Bishop and Alderman were absolute Iudges in
euery Shire, and the Bishop in many causes
shared in forfeitures and penalties with the
King; he clipped the wings of their Temporall
power, and confined them within the limits of
their Ecclesiasticall Iurisdiction; to maintaine
the Canons and customes of the Church, to
deale in affaires concerning the soule. He procured
<i>Stigand</i> Archbishop of <i>Canterburie</i>, <i>Agelwine</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
Bishop of <i>East-Angles</i>, and certaine other
Bishops and Abbots, to be depriued by authoritie
from <i>Rome</i>, and deteined them in prison
during their liues, that strangers might enioy
their places. The matters obiected against <i>Stigand</i>
were these.</p>

<blockquote><p>1 <i>That hee had entruded vpon the Archbishopricke
whilest Robert the Archb. was in life.</i></p>

<p>2 <i>That he receiued his Pall from Benedict the
fifth, who for buying the Papacie had bene deposed.</i></p>

<p>3 <i>That hee kept the Sea of Winchester in his
handes, after his inuestiture into the Sea of Canterburie.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>He was otherwise also infamous in life; altogether
vnlearned, of heauie iudgement and vnderstanding,
sottishly seruiceable both to pleasure
and sloath; in couetousnesse beneath the
basenesse of rusticitie: insomuch as he would
often sweare, that he had not one penie vpon
the earth, and yet by a key which hee did
weare about his necke, great treasures of his
were found vnder the ground. And this was a
griefe and sicknesse to honest mindes, that such
spurious and impure creatures should susteine,
or rather destaine the reuerence and maiestie
of Religion.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span></p>

<p>Further, the King caused all the Monasteries
and Abbeys to be searched, pretending that
the richer sort of the <i>English</i> had layd vp their
money in them: vnder colour whereof he discouered
the state of all, and bereaued many of
their owne treasure. Some of these Religious
houses he appropriated wholly to himselfe; of
diuers others he seized the liberties, which they
redeemed afterward at a very high and excessiue
rate. Those Bishopricks and Abbeis which
held Baronies, and had bene free before from
secular subiection, he reduced vnder the charge
of his seruice; appointing how many Souldiers,
and of what sort, they should furnish for him
and his successours in the time of their warres.
Those strangers which he entertained in pay,
he dispersed into Religious houses, and some also
among the Nobilitie, to be maintained at
their charge: whereby he not onely fauoured
his owne purse, but had them as a watch, and
sometimes as a garrison ouer those, of whose alleageance
he stood in doubt.</p>

<p>Now against the inferiour sort of people,
knowing right well that hee was generally hated,
hee prepared these remedies for his estate:
All their armour was taken from them, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
were crushed downe with change of calamity,
which held them prostrate vnder yoke, and
brake the very heart of their courage: leauing
them no hope to be relieued, no hope to rise into
any degree of libertie, but by yeelding entire
obedience vnto him. Those who either resisted
or fauoured not his first entrance, he bereaued
of all meanes afterward to offend him; holding
them downe, and keeping them so lowe, that
their very impotencie made him secure. All
such as had their hand in any rebellion, albeit
they were pardoned their liues, lost their liuings,
and became vassals to those Lords to
whom their possessions were giuen. And if
they attained any thing afterward, they held it
onely at the pleasure of their Lords; at the
pleasure of their Lords they might bee despoyled.</p>

<p>Hee much condemned the iudgement of
<i>Swanus</i> the <i>Dane</i>, sometimes King of <i>England</i>,
who permitted those whom hee had vanquished,
to retaine their former both authoritie
and estates: whereby it happened, that after
his death, the inhabitants were of force to expell
the strangers, and to quit themselues both
from their societie and subiection. Hereupon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
many seuere lawes were made; diuers of all
sorts were put to death, banished, stripped of
their wealth, disabled in their bodies by vnusuall
variety of punishments; as putting out the
eyes, cutting off the hands and such like: not
onely to diminish his feares, if they were suspected;
but sometimes if they were of wealth, to
satisfie therewith either his pleasure or wants.
His cruelty made the people rebellious, and
their rebellions made him the more cruell; in
which case many Innocents were made the
oblations of his ambitious feares. Many heauy
taxations were imposed vpon them; their ancient
Lords were remoued, their ancient lawes
and policies of State were dashed to dust; all
lay couched vnder the Conquerours sword,
to bee newly fashioned by him, as should bee
best fitting for his aduantage.</p>

<p>Hee erected Castels in diuers parts of the
Realme, of which the Towre neere <i>London</i>
was the chiefe, which afterward was increased
both in compasse and in strength by addition
of the outward walls. In these he planted garrisons
of <i>Normans</i>, as if it had bene in a hostile
Countrey; not without oppression to the people
although they remained quiet, and suffi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>cient
to suppresse them if they should rebell.
Thus he secured the Realme against a generall
defection; as for particular stirres, they might
happily molest him, but endanger him they
could not. <i>Exceter</i>, <i>Northumberland</i>, and some
other parts did rise against him in armes; but
being vnable to maintaine their reuolt, their ouerthrow
did much confirme his State.</p>

<p>Hee either imitated or concurred with <i>Cæsar</i>
in aduise: For, as <i>Cæsar</i> inuaded the <i>Germans</i>
which kept the great forrest of <i>Ardenna</i>,
not with his owne Souldiers, but with his aides
out of <i>Gallia</i>; gaining thereby victory ouer the
one, and securitie from the other, without any
dispence of the <i>Romane</i> blood: so after the
Kings great victory against the valiant, but too
aduenturous King <i>Harold</i>, when many of the
English fled into <i>Ireland</i>, and from thence with
fresh both courage, and supplies returned into
<i>England</i>; commaunded by two of <i>Harolds</i>
sonnes; hee encountred them onely with
<i>English</i> forces. In the first conflict the Kings
partie was ouerthrowen, and the valiant leader
<i>Ednothus</i> slaine, who had bene master of
the horses to King <i>Harold</i>. In the second his
enemies were so defeated, as they were neuer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
able to make head againe. So the victorers being
weakened, and the vanquished wasted, the
King with pleasure triumphed ouer both. Likewise
when he was occasioned to passe the Seas
into <i>Normandie</i>, either to establish affaires of
gouernement, or to represse rebellions, which
in his absence were many times raised; he drew
his forces out of <i>England</i>, and that in a more
large proportion then the importance of the
seruice did require. Hee also tooke with him
the chiefe men of <i>English</i> blood, as well to vse
their aduise and aide, as also to hold them and
their friends from working innouation in his
absence.</p>

<p>He enclosed the great Forrest neere vnto
the Sea in <i>Hamshire</i>, for which he dispeopled
villages and townes, about the space of thirtie
miles, to make a desert for beasts of chase; in
which place afterward two of his sonnes, <i>Richard</i>
and <i>William</i> ended their liues; <i>Richard</i> by
a fall from his horse, and <i>William</i> by the stroke
of an arrow. The Kings great delight in hunting
was made the pretence of this Forrest; but
the true end was rather, to make a free place
of footing for his <i>Normans</i> and other friends
out of France, in case any great reuolt should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
be made. Diuers other parts of the Realme
were so wasted with his warres, that for want
both of Husbandrie and habitation, a great
dearth did ensue; whereby many were inforced
to eate horses, dogs, cats, rats, and other
loathsome and vile vermine: yea, some absteined
not from the flesh of men. This famine
and desolation did especially rage in the North
parts of the Realme. For the inhabitants beyond
<i>Humber</i>, fearing the Kings secret hate, so
much the more deepe and deadly because vniust;
receiued without resistance, and perhaps
drew in the Armie of the King of <i>Sueueland</i>,
with whom <i>Edgar Atheling</i> and the other <i>English</i>
that fled into <i>Scotland</i> ioyned their power.
The <i>Normans</i> within <i>Yorke</i> fired the suburbs,
because it should not be a lodging for their
enemies: but the strength of the winde caried
the flame into the Citie, which consumed a
great part thereof, with the Minster of S. <i>Peter</i>,
and therein a faire Librarie. And herewith
whilest the <i>Normans</i> were partly busied, and
partly amazed, the enemies entred, and slue in
<i>Yorke</i>, in <i>Duresme</i>, and thereabout, three thousand
<i>Normans</i>; among whom were many of
eminent dignitie, as well for birth, as for place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
of their charge. But in short time the King
came vpon them, and hauing partly by Armes,
and partly by gifts dispatched the strangers,
exercised vpon the <i>English</i> an ancient and assured
experience of warre, to represse with maine
force a rebellion in a State newly subdued. Insomuch
as all the land betweene <i>Duresme</i> and
<i>Yorke</i>, except onely the territorie of S. <i>Iohn</i> of
<i>Beuerlace</i>, lay waste for the space of nine yeeres,
without inhabitants to manure the ground.</p>

<p>And because conspiracies and associations
are commonly contriued in the night, he commanded,
that in all Townes and villages a Bell
should be runge in the euening at eight of the
clocke; and that in euery house they should
then put foorth their fire and lights, and goe to
bed. This custome of ringing a Bell at that
houre, in many places is still obserued.</p>

<p>And for that likenesse is a great cause of liking
and of loue, he enioyned the chiefe of the
<i>English</i> (and these were soone imitated by the
rest) to conforme themselues to the fashions of
<i>Normandie</i>, to which they had made themselues
no strangers before. Yea, children in
the schoole were taught their letters and principles
of grammar in the <i>Norman</i> language. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
their speech, attire, shauing of the beard, seruice
at the Table; in their buildings and houshold
furniture, they altogether resembled the
<i>Normans</i>.</p>

<p>In the beginning of his reigne he ordeined
that the Lawes of King <i>Edward</i> should be obserued,
together with those Lawes which hee
did prescribe: but afterwards he commanded
that 9. men should be chosen out of euery
shire, to make a true report what were the
Lawes and customes of the Realme. Of these
hee changed the greatest part, and brought in
the customes of <i>Normandie</i> in their stead: commanding
also that causes should be pleaded,
and all matters of forme dispatched in <i>French</i>.
Onely hee permitted certaine <i>Dane</i>-Lawes,
(which before were chiefly vsed in <i>Northfolke</i>,
<i>Suffolke</i>, and <i>Cambridge</i>-shire) to be generally
obserued; as hauing great affinitie with his
<i>Norman</i>-customes; both being deriued from
one common head.</p>

<p>Likewise at the great suit of <i>William</i> a <i>Norman</i>
then Bishop of <i>London</i>, he granted a Charter
of libertie to that Citie, for enioying the vse
of K. <i>Edwards</i> Lawes: a memoriall of which
benefite, the Citizens fixed vpon the Bishops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
graue, being in the middest of the great West
Ile of S. <i>Pauls</i>. Further, by the counsaile of
<i>Stigand</i> Archb. of <i>Canterburie</i>, and of <i>Eglesine</i>
Abbot of S. <i>Augustines</i> (who at that time were
the chiefe gouernours of <i>Kent</i>) as the King was
riding towards <i>Douer</i>, at <i>Swanescombe</i> two mile
from <i>Grauesend</i>, the <i>Kentish</i> men came towards
him armed, and bearing boughes in their
hands, as if it had bene a moouing wood; they
encloased him vpon the sudden, and with a
firme countenance, but words well tempered
with modestie and respect, they demanded of
him the vse of their ancient Liberties and
Lawes: that in other matters they would yeeld
obedience vnto him: that without this they
desired not to liue. The King was content to
strike saile to the storme, and to giue them a
vaine satisfaction for the present; knowing
right well, that the generall customes &amp; Lawes
of the residue of the Realme, would in short
time ouerflow these particular places. So
pledges being giuen on both sides, they conducted
him to <i>Rochester</i>, and yeelded the
Countie of <i>Kent</i> and the Castle of <i>Douer</i> into
his power.</p>

<p>In former times many Farmes and Mannors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
were giuen by bare word, without writing,
onely with the sword of the Lord, or his head-peece;
with a horne or standing goblet, and
many tenements with a quill, with a horse-combe,
with a bow, with an arrow; but this sincere
simplicitie at that time was changed. And
whereas Charters and deeds were before made
firme by the subscription of the partie, with
crosses of gold, or of some other colour; then
they were firmed by the parties speciall Seale,
set vpon waxe, vnder the <i>Teste</i> of three or foure
witnesses.</p>

<p>He ordained also his counsaile of State, his
Chancery, his Exchequer, his Courts of Iustice,
which alwaies remoued with his Court. These
places he furnished with Officers, and assigned
foure Termes in the yere for determining controuersies
among the people: whereas before
all suites were summarily heard and determined
in the <i>Gemote</i> or monthly conuention in
euery hundred, without either formalities or
delay.</p>

<p>He caused the whole Realme to be described
in a censuall Roll, so as there was not one Hide
of land, but both the yerely rent and the owner
thereof, was therein set downe; how many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
plowlands, what pastures, fennes, or marishes;
what woods, parkes, farmes and tenements
were in euery shire; and what euery one was
worth. Also how many villaines euery man
had, what beasts or cattell, what fees, what other
goods, what rent or commoditie his possessions
did yeeld. This booke was called <i>The
Roll of Winton</i>, because it was kept in the Citie
of <i>Winchester</i>. By the <i>English</i> it was called
<i>Doomes day booke</i>; either by reason of the generalitie
thereof, or else corruptly in stead of <i>Domus
Dei booke</i>; for that it was layed in the
Church of <i>Winchester</i>, in a place called <i>Domus
Dei</i>. According to this Roll taxations were imposed;
sometimes two shillings, and sometimes
sixe shillings vpon euery hide of land (a hide
conteyning 20. acres,) besides ordinarie prouision
for his house.</p>

<p>In all those lands which hee gaue to any
man, he reserued <i>Dominion in chiefe</i> to himselfe:
for acknowledgement whereof a yeerely rent
was payd vnto him, and likewise a fine whensoeuer
the Tenant did alien or die. These were
bound as Clients vnto him by oath of fidelitie
and homage; And if any died his heire being
in minoritie, the King receiued the profits of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
the land, and had the custodie and disposing
of the heires body, vntill his age of one and
twentie yeeres.</p>

<p>It is reported of <i>Caligula</i>,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> that when he entended
to make aduantage of his penal Edicts,
he caused them to be written in so small letters,
and the tables of them to be fastened so high,
that it was almost impossible for any man to
read them. So the King caused part of those
Lawes that he established, to be written in the
<i>Norman</i> language, which was a barbarous and
broken <i>French</i>, not well vnderstood of the naturall
<i>French</i>, and not at all of the vulgar <i>English</i>.
The residue were not written at all, but
left almost arbitrarie, to be determined by reason
and discretion at large. Hereupon it followed,
partly through ignorance of the people,
and partly through the malice of some officers
of Iustice, who many times are instruments
of secret and particular ends; that many
were extreamely intangled, many endangered,
many rather made away, then iustly executed.</p>

<p>But here it may be questioned, seeing these
Lawes were layed vpon the <i>English</i>, as fetters about
their feet, as a ponderous yoke vpon their
necke, to depresse and deteine them in sure sub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>iection;
how it falleth, that afterward they became
not onely tolerable, but acceptable and
well esteemed.</p>

<p>Assuredly, these lawes were exceeding harsh
and heauy to the <i>English</i> at the first: And therefore
K. <i>William Rufus</i>, and <i>Henry</i> the first, at
such time as <i>Robert</i> their eldest brother came
in armes against them to challenge the crowne,
being desirous to winne the fauour of the people,
did fill them with faire promises, to abrogate
the lawes of K. <i>William</i> their father, and to
restore to them the Lawes of K. <i>Edward</i>. The
like was done by K. <i>Stephen</i>, and by K. <i>Henry</i>
the second; whilest both contending to draw
the State to himselfe, they did most grieuously
teare it in pieces. The like by others of the first
Kings of the <i>Norman</i> race, whensoeuer they
were willing to giue contentment to the people:
who desired no other reward for all their
aduentures and labours, for al their blood spent
in the seruice of their Kings, but to haue the
Lawes of K. <i>Edward</i> restored. At the last the
Nobilitie of the Realme, with great dispence
both of their estates and blood, purchased a
Charter of libertie, First from K. <i>Iohn</i>, which
was soone reuoked, as violently enforced from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
him: afterwards from King <i>Henry</i> the third,
which remained in force. And hereby the
sharpe seuerity of these lawes was much abated.</p>

<p>In that afterwards they became, not onely
tolerable, but easie and sweete, and happily not
fit to bee changed, it is by force of long grounded
custome, whereby those vsages which our
ancestors haue obserued for many ages, do neuer
seeme either grieuous or odious to bee endured.
So <i>Nicetas</i> writing of certaine Christians,
who by long conuersing with the <i>Turkes</i>,
had defiled themselues with Turkish fashions,
<i>Custome</i><a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> (saith he) <i>winneth such strength by time,
that it is more firme then either Nature or Religion</i>.
Hereupon <i>Dio. Chrysostome</i> compareth
Customes to a King,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> and Edicts to a Tyrant;
because we are subiect voluntarily to the one,
but by constraint and vpon necessitie to the
other. <i>It is manifest</i> (saith <i>Agathias</i>) <i>that vnder
whatsoeuer law a people hath liued, they doe esteeme
the same most excellent and diuine</i>.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> <i>Herodotus</i>
reporteth, that <i>Darius</i> the sonne of <i>Hysdaspis</i>,
hauing vnder his Dominion certaine
<i>Grecians</i> of <i>Asia</i>, who accustomed to burne
their dead parents and friends, and certaine na<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>tions
of <i>India</i>, who vsed to eate them; called
the <i>Grecians</i> before him: and told them that it
was his pleasure, that they should conforme
themselues to the custome of the <i>Indians</i>, in eating
their deceased friends. But they applied all
meanes of intreatie and perswasion, that they
might not be inforced, to such a barbarous, or
rather brutish obseruation. Then hee sent for
the <i>Indians</i>, and mooued them to conformitie
with the <i>Grecians</i>; but found that they did farre
more abhorre to burne their dead, then the
<i>Grecians</i> did to eate them.</p>

<p>Now these seuerities of the King were much
aggrauated by the <i>English</i>, and esteemed not
farre short of cruelties. Notwithstanding hee
tempered it with many admirable actions both
of iustice and of clemencie and mercie: for
which hee is much extolled by the <i>Normane</i><a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
writers. Hee gaue great priuiledges to many
places; &amp; the better to giue the people contentment,
and to hold them quiet, he often times
renued the oath which first he tooke at his Coronation:
namely, <i>to defend the holy Church of
God, the pastors thereof, and the people subiect to
him iustly to gouerne, to ordaine good lawes, and obserue
true iustice, and to the vttermost of his power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
to withstand all rapines and false Iudgements.</i> Such
of the nobilitie as had been taken in rebellion,
were onely committed to prison; from which
they were released in time: such as yeelded and
submitted themselues, were freely pardoned,
and often times receiued to fauour, trust, and
imployment.</p>

<p><i>Edric</i>, the first that rebelled after hee was
King, he held neere and assured vnto him. <i>Gospatric</i>
who had been a stirrer of great commotions,
he made Earle of <i>Glocester</i>, and employed
him against <i>Malcolme</i> King of <i>Scots</i>. <i>Eustace</i>
Earle of <i>Bologne</i>, who vpon occasion of the
Kings first absence in <i>Normandie</i> attempted
to surprize the Castle of <i>Douer</i>, he imbraced afterward
with great shew of loue and respect.
<i>Waltheof</i> sonne to Earle <i>Siward</i>, who in defending
the Citie of <i>Yorke</i> against him, had
slaine many <i>Normans</i>, as they assayed to enter
a breach, hee ioyned in marriage to his Neece
<i>Iudeth</i>. <i>Edgar</i> who was the ground and hope of
all conspiracies, who after his first submission
to the King, fled into <i>Scotland</i>, and maintained
open hostilitie against him, who pretended
title to the Crowne as next heire to the <i>Saxon</i>
Kings, he not onely receiued to fauour, but ho<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>noured
with faire enterteinments. Hee furnished
him to the warre of <i>Palestine</i>, where he
atteined an honourable estimation with the
Emperours of <i>Almaine</i> and of <i>Greece</i>. After his
returne he was allowed 20. shillings a day by
way of pension, and large liuings in the Countrey,
where he mellowed to old age in pleasure
and vacancie of affaires; preferring safe subiection,
before ambitious rule accompanied both
with danger and disquiet.</p>

<p>Thus was no man more milde to a relenting
and vanquished enemie; as farre from
crueltie, as he was from cowardice, the height
of his spirit, ouerlooking all casuall, all doubtfull
and vncertaine dangers. Other great offenders
he punished commonly by exile or imprisonment,
seldome by death. Onely among
the <i>English</i> Nobilitie Earle <i>Waltheof</i> was put to
death, for that after twice breaking allegiance,
he conspired the third time with diuers both
<i>English</i> and <i>Normans</i> to receiue the <i>Danes</i> into
<i>England</i>, whilest the King was absent in <i>Normandie</i>.
And for the same conspiracie <i>Ralph
Fitz-aubert</i> a <i>Norman</i> was also executed; who
had furnished 40. ships for the King in his voiage
for <i>England</i>: for which and for his other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
seruices in that warre, he was afterward created
Earle of <i>Hereford</i>. But present iniuries doe alwayes
ouerballance benefits that are past.</p>

<p>He much delighted in hunting and in feasting.
For the first he enclosed many forrests
and parks, and filled them with Deere; which
he so deerely loued, that he ordained great penalties
for such as should kill those or any other
beasts of game. For the second hee made
many sumptuous feasts, especially vpon the
high Festiuall dayes in the yeere. His <i>Christmasse</i>
hee often kept at <i>Glocester</i>, his <i>Easter</i> at
<i>Winchester</i>, his <i>Whitsontide</i> at <i>Westminster</i>; and
was crowned once in the yeere at one of these
places, so long as he continued in <i>England</i>. To
these feasts he inuited all his Nobilitie, and did
then principally compose himselfe to courtesie,
as well in familiar conuersation, as in facilitie to
grant suits, and to giue pardon to such as had
offended. At other times he was more Maiesticall
and seuere; and imployed himselfe both
to much exercise and great moderation in diet;
whereby he preserued his body in good state,
both of health and strength, and was easily
able to endure trauaile, hunger, heat, cold, and
all other hardnesse both of labour and of want.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span></p>

<p>Many wrongs he would not see, of many
smarts he would not complaine; he was absolute
master of himselfe, and thereby learned to
subdue others. He was much commended for
chastitie of body; by which his Princely actions
were much aduanced. And albeit the beginning
of his reigne was pestered with such
routs of outlawes and robbers, that the peaceable
people could not accompt themselues in
surety within their owne doores; hee so well
prouided for execution of Iustice vpon offenders,
or rather for cutting off the causes of offence;
that a young maiden well charged with
gold, might trauaile in any part of the Realme,
without any offer of iniurie vnto her. For if any
man had slaine another vpon any cause, he was
put to death; and if he could not be found, the
hundred paide a fine to the King; sometimes
28. and sometimes 36. pounds, according to the
largenesse of the hundred in extent. If a man
had oppressed any woman, he was depriued of
his priuie parts. As the people by Armes, so
Armes by lawes were held in restraint.</p>

<p>He talked little and bragged lesse: a most
assured performer of his word: In prosecution
or his purposes constant and strong, and yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
not obstinate; but alwayes appliable to the
change of occasions: earnest, yea violent, both
to resist his enemies, and to exact dueties of his
Subiects. He neither loued much speech, nor
gaue credite to faire; but trusted truely to himselfe,
to others so farre as he might not be abused
by credulitie.</p>

<p>His expedition (the spirit of actions and affaires)
may hereby appeare. He inuaded <i>England</i>
about the beginning of October; He subdued
all resistance, he suppressed all rising Rebellions,
and returned into <i>Normandy</i> in March
following. So as the time of the yeere considered,
a man should hardly trauaile through the
land in so short a time as he did win it. A greater
exploit then <i>Iulius Cæsar</i> or any other stranger
could euer atchieue vpon that place.</p>

<p>He gaue many testimonies of a Religious
minde. For he did often frequent Diuine seruice
in the Church, he gaue much Almes, hee
held the Clergie in great estimation, and highly
honoured the Prelats of the Church. He sent
many costly ornaments, many rich presents of
gold and siluer to the Church of <i>Rome</i>; his
<i>Peter</i> paiments went more readily, more largely
then euer before. To diuers Churches in <i>France</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
after his victorie he sent Crosses of gold, vessels
of gold, rich Palles, or other ornaments of great
beautie and price. He bare such reuerence to
<i>Lanfranck</i> Archbishop of <i>Canterburie</i>, that he
seemed to stand at his directions. At the request
of <i>Wolstane</i> Bishop of <i>Worcester</i>, he gaue
ouer a great aduantage that he made by sale of
prisoners taken in <i>Ireland</i>. He respected <i>Aldred</i>
Archbishop of <i>Yorke</i>, by whom he had bene
crowned King of <i>England</i>, as his father. At a
time vpon the repulse of a certaine suit, the
Archbishop brake forth into discontentment,
expostulated sharpely against the King, and in
a humorous heat offered to depart. But the
King staied him, fell downe at his feet, desired
pardon, and promised satisfaction in the best
maner that he could. The Nobilitie that were
present, put the Archbishop in minde that he
should cause the King to arise. Nay (answered
the Archb.) let him alone; Let him still abide
at S. <i>Peters</i> feet. So with much adoe he was appeased,
and entreated to accept his suite.
And so the name of Saint <i>Peter</i>, and of the
Church hath been often vsed as a mantle, to
couer the pride, passions and pleasures of disordered
men.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span></p>

<p>He founded and enlarged many houses of
Religion: Hee furnished Ecclesiasticall dignities,
with men of more sufficiencie and worth
then had been vsuall in former times. And because
within his owne Dominions studies did
not flourish and thriue, by reason of the turbulent
times, by reason of the often inuasions of
barbarous people, whose knowledge lay chiefly
in their fists; hee drew out of <i>Italy</i> and other
places many famous men, both for learning
and integritie of life, to wit, <i>Lanfranke</i>,
<i>Anselm</i>, <i>Durand</i>, <i>Traherne</i> and others. These
he honoured, these hee aduanced, to these hee
expressed great testimonies both of fauour and
regard.</p>

<p>And yet he preferred <i>Odo</i> his brother by the
mothers side to the Bishopricke of <i>Baion</i>, and
afterwards created him Earle of <i>Kent</i>: A man
proud, vaine, mutinous, ambitious; outragious
in oppression, cruelty and lust; a prophaner of
Religion, a manifest contemner of all vertue.
The King being called by occasions into <i>Normandie</i>,
committed vnto him the gouernment
of the Realme: In which place of credite and
command he furnished himselfe so fully with
treasure, that hee aspired to the Papacie of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
<i>Rome</i>: vpon a prediction then cast abroad,
(which commonly deceiue those that trust vnto
them) that the successour of <i>Hildebrand</i> was
named <i>Odo</i>. So filled with proud hopes, hee
purchased a palace and friends at <i>Rome</i>; hee
prepared for his iourney, and drew many gentlemen
to be of his traine. But the King returning
suddenly out of <i>Normandie</i>, met with
him in the <i>Isle of Wight</i>, as he was ready to take
the Seas. There hee was arrested, and afterwards
charged with infinite oppressions; also
for seducing the Kings subiects to forsake the
Realme; and lastly, for sacrilegious spoyling of
many Churches. Hereupon his treasure was
seized, and he was committed to prison; not as
Bishop of <i>Baion</i>, but as Earle of <i>Kent</i>, and as
an accomptant to the King. And so he remained
about foure yeeres, euen vntill the death
of the King. His seruants, some in falshood,
and some for feare, discouered such hidden
heapes of his gold, as did exceede all expectation:
yea, many bagges of grinded gold were
drawen out of riuers, wherein the Bishop had
caused them for a time to be buried. After this
hee was called the Kings spunge: as being preferred
by him to that place of charge, wherein<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
he might in long time sucke that from others,
which should at once be pressed from himselfe.
By this meanes the King had the benefit of his
oppression without the blame; and the people
(being no deepe searchers into secrets of State)
were so well pleased with the present punishment,
as they were thereby, although not satisfied,
yet well quieted for all their wrongs.</p>

<p>Towards the end of his reigne he appointed
his two sonnes, <i>Robert</i> and <i>Henry</i>, with ioynt
authoritie, gouernours of <i>Normandie</i>; the one
to suppresse either the insolencie, or leuitie of
the other. These went together to visit the
<i>French</i> King, lying at <i>Conflance</i>: where entertaining
the time with varietie of disports, <i>Henry</i>
played with <i>Louis</i> then <i>Daulphine</i> of <i>France</i> at
Chesse, and did win of him very much. Here at
<i>Louis</i> beganne to growe warme in words, and
was therein little respected by <i>Henry</i>. The great
impatiencie of the one, and the small forbearance
of the other, did strike in the end such a
heate betweene them, that <i>Louis</i> threw the
Chesse-men at <i>Henries</i> face, and called him the
sonne of a bastard. <i>Henrie</i> againe stroke <i>Louis</i>
with the Chesse-boord, drew blood with the
blowe, and had presently slaine him vpon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
place, had hee not been stayed by his brother
<i>Robert</i>. Hereupon they presently went to
horse, and their spurres claimed so good haste,
as they recouered <i>Pontoise</i>, albeit they were
sharpely pursued by the <i>French</i>.</p>

<p>It had been much for the <i>French</i> King to
haue remained quiet, albeit no prouocations
had happened, in regard of his pretence to many
pieces which King <i>William</i> did possesse in
<i>France</i>. But vpon this occasion he presently
inuaded <i>Normandie</i>, tooke the Citie of <i>Vernon</i>,
and drew <i>Robert</i>, King <i>Williams</i> eldest sonne,
to combine with him against his owne father.
On the other side King <i>William</i>, who neuer lost
anything by loosing of time, with incredible
celeritie passed into <i>France</i>; inuaded the <i>French</i>
Kings dominions, wasted and tooke many
principall places of <i>Zantoigne</i> and <i>Poictou</i>, returned
to <i>Roan</i>, and there reconciled his sonne
<i>Robert</i> vnto him. The <i>French</i> King summoned
him to doe his homage for the kingdome of
<i>England</i>. For the Duchie of <i>Normandie</i> he offered
him homage, but the kingdome of <i>England</i>
(he said) he held of no man, but onely of God,
and by his sword. Hereupon the <i>French</i> King
came strongly vpon him; but finding him both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
ready and resolute to answere in the field: finding
also that his hazard was greater then his
hope; that his losse by ouerthrow would farre
surmount his aduantage by victory; after a
few light encounters he retired: preferring the
care to preserue himselfe, before the desire to
harme others.</p>

<p>King <i>William</i> being then both corpulent and
in yeeres, was distempered in body by meanes
of those trauailes, and so retired to <i>Roan</i>; where
hee remained not perfectly in health. The
<i>French</i> King hearing of his sickenesse, pleasantly
said, that hee lay in child-bed of his great
belly. This would haue been taken in mirth,
if some other had spoken it; but comming from
an enemie, it was taken in scorne. And as
great personages are most sencible of reproach,
and the least touch of honour maketh a wide
and incurable wound; so King <i>William</i> was so
nettled with this ieast, that hee swore <i>By Gods
resurrection and his brightnesse</i>, (for this was the
vsuall forme of his oath) that so soone as hee
should be churched of that child, he would offer
a thousand lights in <i>France</i>. So presently after
his recouery hee entred <i>France</i> in armes,
tooke the Citie of <i>Meux</i>, set many Townes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
and Villages and corne fields on fire; the people
abandoning all places where he came, and
giuing foorth, that it was better the nests should
be destroyed, then that the birds should be taken
in them. At the last he came before <i>Paris</i>,
where <i>Philip</i> King of <i>France</i> did then abide:
to whom he sent word, that he had recouered
to be on foote, and was walking about,
and would be glad likewise to find him abroad.
This enterprise was acted in the moneth of August,
wherein the King was so violent and
sharpe, that by reason both of his trauaile, and
of the vnseasonable heate, he fell into a relapse
of his sicknesse. And to accomplish his mishap,
in leaping on horse-backe ouer a ditch,
his fat belly did beare so hard vpon the pommell
of his saddle, that hee tooke a rupture
in his inner parts. And so ouercharged with
sickenesse, and paine, and disquietnesse of
minde, hee returned to <i>Roan</i>; where his sickenesse
increased by such dangerous degrees,
that in short time it led him to the period of
his dayes.</p>

<p>During the time of his sickenesse hee was
much molested in conscience,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> for the blood
which hee had spilt, and for the seueritie which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
he had vsed against the <i>English</i>: holding himselfe
for that cause more guilty before God,
then glorious among men. Hee spent many
good speeches in reconciling himselfe to God
and the world, &amp; in exhorting others to vertue
and Religion. He gaue great summes of money
to the Clergie of <i>Meux</i>, and of some other
places in <i>France</i>, to repaire the Churches which
a little before he had defaced. To some Monasteries
he gaue tenne markes of gold, and to others
sixe. To euery Parish Church hee gaue
fiue shillings, and to euery Borough Towne a
hundred pounds for reliefe of the poore. Hee
gaue his Crowne, with all the ornaments therto
belonging, to the Church of Saint <i>Stephen</i> in
<i>Caen</i>, which hee had founded: for redeeming
whereof, King <i>Henry</i> the first did afterwards
giue to the same Church the Mannour of
<i>Brideton</i> in <i>Dorcetshire</i>. Hee reteined perfect
memorie and speach so long as he reteined any
breath. Hee ended his life vpon the ninth
day of September: full both of honour and of
age, when hee had reigned twenty yeeres,
eight moneths and sixteene dayes; in the
threescore and fourth yeere of his age.</p>

<p>So soone as he was dead, the chiefe men that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
were about him went to horse, and departed
forthwith to their owne dwellings: to prouide
for the safety of themselues, and of their families
and estates. For all men were possessed with
a marueilous feare, that some dangerous aduentures
would ensue. The seruants and inferiour
Officers also fled away; and to double
the basenesse of their disposition, tooke with
them whatsoeuer was portable about the king;
his Armour, plate, apparell, household-stuffe,
all things were held as lawfull bootie. Thus
the dead body was not onely abandoned, but
left almost naked vpon the ground: where it
remained from prime vntil three of the clocke,
neither guarded nor regarded by any man. In
the meane time the Religious persons went in
procession to the Church of S. <i>Geruase</i>, &amp; there
commended his soule to God. Then <i>William</i>
Archb. of <i>Roan</i> commaunded, that his body
should be caried to <i>Caen</i>, to be there buried in
the Church of S. <i>Stephen</i>. But hee was so forsaken
of all his followers, that there was not
any found who would vndertake either the
care or the charge. At the last <i>Herlwine</i> a countrey
Knight, vpon his owne cost, caused the
body to be embalmed and adorned for funerall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
pompe: then conueyed it by coach to the
mouth of the Riuer <i>Some</i>; and so partly by
land, and partly by sea brought it to <i>Caen</i>.</p>

<p>Here the Abbot with the Couent of Monks
came foorth with all accustomed ceremonies,
to meet the corps: to whom the whole multitude
of the Clergie and Lay-people did adioyne.
But when they were in the middest of
their sad solemnities, a fire brake out of a certaine
house, and suddenly embraced a great
part of the towne. Hereupon the Kings body
was once againe abandoned; all the people
running from it in a headlong haste; some to
saue their goods, others to represse the rage of
the flame, others (as the latest nouelty) to stand
and looke on. In the end a few Moncks returned,
and accompanied the Hearse to the Abbey
Church.</p>

<p>Afterward all the Bishops and Abbots of
<i>Normandy</i> assembled to solemnize the funerall.
And when the diuine Office was ended, and
the coffin of stone set into the earth, in the presbytorie,
betweene the Quire and the Altar (but
the body remained vpon the Herse) <i>Guislebert</i>
bishop of <i>Eureux</i> made a long Sermon; wherein
hee bestowed much breath in extolling the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
honourable actions of the King. In the end he
concluded; That forsomuch as it was impossible
for a man to liue, much lesse to gouerne,
without offence; First, by reason of the multitude
of a Princes affaires; Secondly, for that he
must commit the managing of many things to
the conscience and courtesie of others; Lastly,
for that personall grieuances are many times
beneficiall to the maine body of State; in which
case, particular either losses or harmes, are more
then manifoldly recompenced by the preseruation
or quiet of the whole: If therefore any
that were present did suppose they had receiued
iniurie from the King, he desired that they
would in charitie forgiue him.</p>

<p>When the Bishop had finished his speach,
one <i>Anselme Fitz-Arthur</i> stood vp amongst the
multitude, and with a high voice said; <i>This
ground whereupon wee stand, was sometimes the
floore of my fathers house; which that man of
whom you haue spoken, when he was Duke of Normandie,
tooke violently from my father, and afterward
founded thereon this Religious building. This
iniustice hee did not by ignorance or ouersight; not
vpon any necessitie of State; but to content his
owne couetous desire. Now therefore I doe challenge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
this ground as my right; and doe here charge
you, as you will answere it before the fearefull face
of Almightie God, that the body of the spoiler be not
couered with the earth of mine inheritance.</i></p>

<p>When the Bishops and Noble men that
were present heard this, and vnderstood by the
testimony of many that it was true, they agreed
to giue him three pounds presently for the
ground that was broken for the place of burial;
and for the residue which he claimed, they vndertooke
he should be fully satisfied. This promise
was performed in short time after, by <i>Henrie</i>
the Kings sonne, who onely was present at
the Funerall; at whose appointment <i>Fitz-Arthur</i>
receiued for the price of the same ground
one hundred pounds.</p>

<p>Now when the body was to be put into the
earth, the sepulchre of stone which stood within
the graue, was hewen somewhat too strait
for his fat belly; whereupon they were constrained
to presse it downe with much strength.
By this violence, whether his bowels burst, or
whether some excrements were forced out at
their natural passage, such an intolerable stinck
proceeded from him, as neither the perfumes
that smoaked in great abundance, nor any o<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>ther
meanes were able to qualifie. Wherefore
the Priests hasted to finish their office, and the
people departed in a sad silence; discoursing
diuersly afterward of all these extraordinarie
accidents.</p>

<p>A man would thinke that a sepulchre thus
hardly attained, should not easily againe bee
lost. But it happened otherwise to this vnquiet
King; not destined to rest, either in his life or
after his death. For in the yeere 1562. when
<i>Chastilion</i> tooke the Citie of <i>Caen</i>, with those
broken troupes that escaped at the battaile of
<i>Dreux</i>; certaine sauage Souldiers of diuers nations,
led by foure dissolute Captaines, beate
downe the Monument which King <i>William</i> his
sonne had built ouer him, and both curiously
and richly adorned with gold &amp; costly stones.
Then they opened his Tombe, &amp; not finding
the treasure which they expected, they threw
forth his bones with very great derision &amp; despight.
Many <i>English</i> souldiers were then in the
Towne, who were very curious to gather his
bones; whereof some were afterwards brought
into <i>England</i>. Hereby the report is conuinced
for vaine, that his body was found vncorrupt,
more then foure hundred yeeres after it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
buried. Hereby also it is found to be false, that
his body was eight foote in length. For neither
were his bones proportionable to that stature,
(as it is testified by those who saw them) and it
is otherwise reported of him by som who liued
in his time; namely, that he was of a good stature,
yet not exceeding the ordinary proportion
of men.</p>

<p>And this was the last end of all his fortunes,
of all that was mortall in him besides his fame:
whose life is too much extolled by the <i>Normans</i>,
and no lesse extenuated by the <i>English</i>.
Verely, he was a very great Prince: full of hope
to vndertake great enterprises, full of courage
to atchieue them: in most of his actions commendable,
and excusable in all. And this was
not the least piece of his Honour, that the
Kings of <i>England</i> which succeeded, did accompt
their order onely from him: not in regard
of his victorie in <i>England</i>, but generally
in respect of his vertue and valour.</p>

<p>For his entrance was not by way of conquest
but with pretence of title to the Crowne:
wherein he had both allowance and aide from
diuers Christian Princes in Europe. He had also
his partie within the Realme, by whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
meanes he preuailed against the opposite faction,
(as <i>Cæsar</i> did against <i>Pompey</i>) and not against
the entire strength of the State.</p>

<p>Againe, hee did not settle himselfe in the
chaire of Soueraignetie, as one that had reduced
all things to the proud power and pleasure
of a Conquerour, but as an vniuersall successor
of former Kings, in all the rights and priuiledges
which they did enioy. Hee was receiued
for King by generall consent; He was crowned
with all Ceremonies and Solemnities then in
vse; Hee tooke an oath in the presence of the
Clergie, the Nobilitie, and of much people,
for defence of the Church, for moderate and
carefull gouernement, and for vpright administration
of iustice.</p>

<p>Lastly, during the whole course of his gouernement,
the kingdome receiued no vniuersall
change, no losse or diminution of honour.
For, neither were the olde inhabitants
expelled, as were the <i>Britaines</i>; neither was
the kingdome either subiected or annexed to
a greater: but rather it receiued encrease of honour,
in that a lesse State was adioyned vnto
it. The change of customes was not violent
and at once, but by degrees, and with the silent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
approbation of the <i>English</i>; who haue alwaies
been inclinable to accommodate themselues to
the fashions of <i>France</i>. The grieuances and
oppressions were particular, and with some appearance
either of iustice, or of necessitie for
the common quiet; such as are not vnusuall in
any gouernement moderately seuere. So the
change was chiefly in the stemme and familie
of the King: which whether it be wrought by
one of the same nation (as it was in <i>France</i> by
<i>Pepine</i> and <i>Capett</i>) or by a stranger, (as in the
same Countrey by <i>Henry</i> 5. and <i>Henry</i> 6. Kings
of <i>England</i>) it bringeth no disparagement in
honour; it worketh no essentiall change. The
State still remained the same, the solid bodie
of the State remained still <i>English</i>: the comming
in of many <i>Normans</i>, was but as Riuers
falling into the Ocean; which change not the
Ocean, but are confounded with the waters
thereof.</p>

<p>This King had by his wife <i>Matild</i>, daughter
to <i>Baldwine</i> Earle of <i>Flanders</i>, foure sonnes;
<i>Robert</i>, <i>Richard</i>, <i>William</i> and <i>Henrie</i>: Hee
had also fiue daughters; <i>Cicely</i>, <i>Constance</i>, <i>Adela</i>,
<i>Margaret</i> and <i>Elianor</i>.</p>

<p><i>Robert</i> his eldest sonne surnamed <i>Courtcuise</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
by reason of the shortnesse of his thighs, succeeded
him in the duchie of <i>Normandie</i>. He
was a man of exceeding honourable courage
and spirit, for which cause he was so esteemed
by the Christian Princes in the great warre against
the <i>Saracens</i>, that when they had subdued
the Citie and territorie of <i>Hierusalem</i>,
they offered the kingdome thereof first vnto
him. Yet afterwards, either by the malice of
his Fortune, or for that he was both suddaine
and obstinate in his owne aduise (two great
impediments that valour cannot thriue) he receiued
many foiles of his enemies, which shall
be declared in their proper place. Before the
King made his descent into <i>England</i>, hee gaue
the duchie of <i>Normandie</i> vnto him: but whether
he did this onely to testifie his confidence,
or whether afterwards his purpose changed,
being often demanded to performe this gift, he
would neither deny nor accomplish his word,
but enterposed many excuses and delayes; affirming
that he was not so surely setled in <i>England</i>,
but the duchie of <i>Normandie</i> was necessary
vnto him, both for supply for his seruices
(which he found like <i>Hydraes</i> heads to multiply
by cutting off) and also for an assured place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
for retreit, in case hee should be ouercharged
with extremities. Hereupon <i>Robert</i> vnable to
linger and pine in hopes, declared openly against
him in armes. <i>Philip</i> King of <i>France</i> was
ready to put fuell to the flame; who as he neuer
fauoured in his owne iudgement the prosperous
encreases of the King of <i>England</i>, so
then he was vigilant to embrace all occasions,
either to abate or limit the same. And thus
<i>Robert</i> both encouraged and enabled by the
King of <i>France</i>, inuaded <i>Normandie</i>, and permitted
his souldiers licentiously to wast; to satisfie
those by spoile, which by pay he was not
able to maintaine. At the last he encountred
the King his father in a sharpe conflict, before
the castle of <i>Gerberie</i>, wherein the King was
vnhorsed and wounded in the arme; his second
sonne <i>William</i> was also hurt, and many of
his souldiers slaine. And albeit <i>Robert</i> so soone
as he knew his father by his voyce, allighted
forthwith, mounted him vpon his owne horse,
and withdrew him out of the medley; yet did
he cast vpon his sonne a cruell curse, which lay
so heauie vpon him, that he neuer prospered afterward
in any thing which hee vndertooke.
And although after this he was reconciled to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
his father, and imployed by him in seruices of
credit and weight, yet did the King often bewray
of him an vnquiet conceit, often did he
ominate euill vnto him: yea, a little before his
death he openly gaue forth, <i>That it was a miserable
Countrey which should be subiect to his dominion,
for that he was a proud and foolish knaue, and
to be long scourged by cruell Fortune</i>.</p>

<p><i>Richard</i> had erected the good expectation
of many, as well by his comely countenance
and behauiour, as by his liuely and generous
spirit. But he died yong by misaduenture, as he
was hunting within the New-forrest, before he
had made experiment of his worth. Some affirme
that he was goared to death by the Deere
of that Forrest, for whose walke his father had
dispeopled that large compasse of ground: others
report, that as he rode in chase, hee was
hanged vpon the bough of a tree by the chaps:
others more probably doe write, that he perished
by a fal from his horse. He was buried at
<i>Winchester</i> with this inscription: <i>Hic iacet Richardus
filius Wilielmi senioris Berniæ Dux</i>.</p>

<p><i>William</i> did succeed next to his father in the
Kingdome of <i>England</i>. To <i>Henry</i>, the King
gaue at the time of his death fiue thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
pounds out of his treasure; but gaue him neither
dignitie nor lands: foretelling, that hee
should enioy the honour of both his brothers
in time, and farre excel them both in dominion
and power. Whether this was deuised vpon
euent; or whether some doe prophesie at their
death; or whether it was coniecturally spoken;
or whether to giue contentment for the present;
it fell out afterward to be true. For hee
succeeded <i>William</i> in the Kingdome of <i>England</i>,
and wrested <i>Normandie</i> out of the possession
of <i>Robert</i>. Of these two I shall write more
fully hereafter.</p>

<p>His daughter <i>Cicelie</i> was Abbesse of <i>Caen</i> in
<i>Normandie</i>. <i>Constance</i> was married to <i>Allen
Fergant</i> Earle of <i>Britaine</i>. <i>Adela</i> was wife to
<i>Stephen</i> Earle of <i>Blois</i>, to whom she bare <i>Stephen</i>,
who after the death of <i>Henry</i> was King of
<i>England</i>. <i>Margaret</i> was promised in marriage
to <i>Harold</i>; she died before hee attained the
Kingdome, for which cause he held himselfe
discharged of that oath which he had made to
the Duke her father. <i>Elianor</i> was betroathed
to <i>Alphonso</i> King of <i>Gallicia</i>; but she desired
much to die a Virgine: for this she daily prayed,
and this in the end she did obtaine. After<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
her death her knees appeared brawnie and
hard, with much kneeling at her deuotions.
Assuredly it will be hard to find in any one Familie,
both greater Valour in sonnes, and more
Vertue in daughters.</p>

<p>In the beginning of this Kings reigne, either
no great accidents did fall, or else they
were obscured with the greatnesse of the
change: none are reported by the writers of
that time.</p>

<p>In the fourth yeere of his reigne, <i>Lanfranke</i>
Abbot of <i>Caen</i> in <i>Normandie</i>, but borne in <i>Pauie</i>,
a Citie of <i>Lumbardie</i>, was made Archbishop
of <i>Canterbury</i>: And <i>Thomas</i> a <i>Norman</i>, and
<i>Chanon</i> of <i>Bayon</i> was placed in the Sea of <i>Yorke</i>.
Between these two a controuersie did arise at
the time of their consecration, for prioritie in
place: but this contention was quieted by the
King, and <i>Thomas</i> for the time subscribed obedience
to the Archb. of <i>Canterbury</i>. After this
they went to <i>Rome</i> for their Palles, where the
question for Primacie was againe renued, or as
some affirme, first moued before Pope <i>Alexander</i>.
The Pope vsed them both with honorable
respect, and especially <i>Lanfrank</i>, to whom he
gaue two Palles, one of honour, and the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
of loue: but their controuersie he referred to be
determined in <i>England</i>.</p>

<p>About two yeeres after it was brought before
the King and the Clergie at <i>Windsore</i>. The
Archbishop of <i>Yorke</i> alleadged, that when the
<i>Britaines</i> receiued the Christian faith, in the
time of <i>Lucius</i> their King <i>Eleutherius</i> then Bishop
of <i>Rome</i>, sent <i>Faganus</i> and <i>Damianus</i> vnto
them, who ordeined 28. Bishops, and two
Archbishops within the Realme, one of <i>London</i>,
and the other of <i>Yorke</i>. Vnder these the
Church of <i>Britaine</i> was gouerned almost three
hundred yeeres, vntill they were subdued by
the <i>Saxons</i>. The <i>Saxons</i> remained Infidels vntill
<i>Gregorie</i> Bishop of <i>Rome</i> sent <i>Augustine</i> vnto
them. By his preaching <i>Ethelbert</i> King of
<i>Kent</i> was first conuerted to the Christian faith:
By reason whereof <i>Augustine</i> was made Archbishop
of <i>Douer</i>, by appointment of Pope
<i>Gregorie</i>; who sent vnto him certaine Palles
with his letter from <i>Rome</i>. By this letter it is euident,
that <i>Gregorie</i> intended to reduce the
Church of the <i>Saxons</i> to the same order wherein
it was among the <i>Britaines</i>; namely, to be
vnder twelue Bishops and two Archbishops;
one of <i>London</i> and the other of <i>Yorke</i>. Indeede<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
he gaue to <i>Augustine</i> during his life, authority
and iurisdiction ouer all Bishops and Priests in
<i>England</i>: but after his decease he ioyneth these
two Metropolitanes in equall degree, to constitute
Bishops, to ouersee the Church, to consult
and dispose of such things as appertaine to
the gouernement thereof, as in former times among
the <i>Britaines</i>. Betweene these he put no
distinction in honour, but only as they were in
prioritie of time: and as he appointeth <i>London</i>
to be consecrated by no Bishop, but of his own
Synod, so he expresseth, that the Bishop of <i>Yorke</i>
should not bee subiect to the Bishop of <i>London</i>.
And albeit <i>Augustine</i> for the reason before mentioned,
translated the Sea from <i>London</i> to <i>Douer</i>,
yet if <i>Gregorie</i> had intended to giue the
same authoritie to the successours of <i>Augustine</i>
which hee gaue vnto him, he would haue expressed
it in his Epistle: but in that he maketh
no mention of his successours, he concludeth,
or rather excludeth them by his silence.</p>

<p>The Archbishop of <i>Canterbury</i> alleaged,
that from the time of <i>Augustine</i>, vntill the time
of <i>Bede</i>, (which was about 140. yeeres) the Bishops
of <i>Canterburie</i> (which in ancient time
(said he) was called <i>Douer</i>) had the Primacie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
ouer the whole land of <i>Britaine</i>, and <i>Ireland</i>;
that they did call the Bishops of <i>Yorke</i> to their
Councels, which diuers times they kept within
the Prouince of <i>Yorke</i>; that some Bishops of
<i>Yorke</i> they did constitute, some excommunicate,
and some remoue. He alleaged also diuers
priuiledges granted by Princes for the Primacie
of that Sea; diuers graunted from the Apostolike
Sea to confirme this dignitie in the successours
of <i>Augustine</i>: that it is reason to receiue
directions of well liuing, from whence we first
receiued directions of right beleeuing; &amp; therfore
as the Bishop of <i>Canterbury</i> was subiect to
the Bishop of <i>Rome</i>, because hee had his faith
from thence; for the very same cause the Bishop
of <i>Yorke</i> should be in subiection to the Bishop
of <i>Canterbury</i>: that like as the Lord said
that to all the Bishops of <i>Rome</i>, which hee said
to S. Peter; so that which <i>Gregorie</i> said to <i>Augustine</i>,
hee said likewise to all his successours.
And whereas much is spoken of the Bishop of
<i>London</i>, what is that to the Archbishop of <i>Canterbury</i>?
For, neither is it certaine that <i>Augustine</i>
was euer resident at <i>London</i>, neither that
<i>Gregorie</i> appointed him so to be.</p>

<p>In the end it was decreed, That <i>Yorke</i> for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
that time should be subiect to <i>Canterburie</i>; that
wheresoeuer within <i>England</i> the Archbishop
of <i>Canterburie</i> should hold his Councell, the
Archbishop of <i>Yorke</i> should come vnto it, with
the Bishops of his Prouince, and be obedient
to his decrees: that when the Archbishop of
<i>Canterburie</i> should decease, the Archbishop of
<i>Yorke</i> should goe to <i>Canterburie</i>, to consecrate
him that should succeed: that if the Archbishop
of <i>Yorke</i> should decease, his successour should
goe to <i>Canterbury</i>, or to such place as the Archbishop
of <i>Canterburie</i> should appoint, there to
receiue his Consecration, making first his oath
of Canonicall obedience. And thus was the
contention for this first time taken vp; but in
succeeding times it was often renued, and
much busied the Clergie of the Realme.</p>

<p>In the ninth yeere of the reigne of King <i>William</i>
a Councell was holden at <i>London</i>, where
another matter of like qualitie and nature was
decreed: namely, that Bishops should translate
their Sees from villages to Cities; whereupon
in short time after, Bishops Sees were remoued,
from <i>Selese</i> to <i>Chichester</i>, from <i>Cornewall</i>
to <i>Exeter</i>, from <i>Wells</i> to <i>Bath</i>, from <i>Shirbourne</i>
to <i>Salisburie</i>, from <i>Dorcester</i> to <i>Lincolne</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
from <i>Lichfield</i> to <i>Chester</i>, and from thence againe
to <i>Couentree</i>. And albeit the Archbishop
of <i>Yorke</i> did oppose against the erecting
of a Cathedrall Church in <i>Lincolne</i>, because he
challenged that Citie to be of his Prouince; yet
<i>Remigius</i> Bishop of <i>Dorchester</i>, being strong
both in resolution and in friends, did prosecute
his purpose to effect. Not long before the Bishopricke
of <i>Lindafferne</i> otherwise called <i>Holy
land</i>, vpon the riuer <i>Tweed</i>, had bene translated
to <i>Durhame</i>.</p>

<p>In the tenth yeere of his reigne the cold of
Winter was exceeding memorable, both for
sharpenesse and for continuance: For the earth
remained hard frozen from the beginning of
Nouember, vntill the middest of April then
ensuing.</p>

<p>In the 15. yere a great earthquake happened
in the month of April; strange for the strong
trembling of the earth, but more strange for the
dolefull and hideous roaring which it yeelded
foorth.</p>

<p>In the 20. yeere there fell such abundance of
raine, that the Riuers did greatly ouerflow in
all parts of the Realme. The springs also rising
plentifully in diuers hils, so softned and decaied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
the foundations of them, that they fell downe,
whereby some villages were ouerthrowne. By
this distemperature of weather much cattel perished,
much corne vpon the ground was either
destroyed, or greatly empaired. Herehence
ensued, first a famine, and afterwards a
miserable mortalitie of men.</p>

<p>And that all the Elements might seeme to
haue conspired the calamity of the Realme, the
same yeere most of the principall Cities in <i>England</i>
were lamentably deformed with fire. At
<i>London</i> a fire began at the entry of the West
gate, which apprehending certaine shops and
Ware-houses, wherein was Merchandise apt
to burne, it was at once begun and suddenly at
the highest. Then being caried with a strong
wind; and the Citie apt to maintaine the flame,
as well by reason of the crooked and narrow
streets, as for that the buildings at that time
had open and wide windowes, and were couered
with base matter fit to take fire, the mischiefe
spread more swiftly then the remedies
could follow. So it raged vntill it came to the
East gate, prostrated houses and Churches all
the way, being the most grieuous that euer as
yet hath happened to that Citie. The Church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
of S. <i>Paul</i> was at that time fired; Whereupon
<i>Maurice</i> then Bishop of <i>London</i>, began the
foundation of the new Church of S. <i>Paul</i>. A
worke so admirable, that many did iudge, it
would neuer haue bene finished; yet all might
easily esteeme thereby his magnanimitie, his
high erected hopes, his generous loue and honour
to Religion. The King gaue towards
the building of the East end of this Church, the
choise stones of his Castle at the West end of
the Citie, vpon the bancke of the Riuer
Thames; which Castle at the same time was
also fired: in place whereof <i>Edward Killwarby</i>
Archbishop of <i>Canterburie</i> did afterwards
found a Monasterie of blacke Friers. The
King also gaue the Castle of <i>Storford</i>, and all
the lands which thereto belonged, to the same
<i>Maurice</i>, and to his successours in that See.
And doubtlesse nothing more then either parcimonious
or prophane expending the Treasures
of the Church, hath since those times
much dried vp those fountaines which first did
fill them.</p>

<p>After the death of <i>Maurice</i>, <i>Richard</i> his
next Successour, as well in vertue as in dignitie,
bestowed all the Rents rising out of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
Bishopricke, to aduance the building of this
Church; maintaining himselfe by his Patrimonie
and friendes: and yet all which hee
could doe, made no great shewe: so that the
finishing of this worke was left to many other
succeeding Bishops. Hee purchased
the ground about the Church whereupon
many buildings did stand, and inclosed the
same with a strong wall of stone for a place of
buriall. It seemeth that this wall was afterwards
either battered and torne in some ciuill
warres, or else by negligence suffered to
decay: for that a graunt was made by King
<i>Edward</i> the second, that the Church-yard of
Saint <i>Pauls</i> should bee enclosed with a wall,
because of the robberies and murthers that
were there committed. Many parts of this
wall remaine at this time, on both sides of the
Church, but couered for the most part with
dwelling houses.</p>

<p>The same yeere in Whitsun-weeke, the
King honoured his sonne <i>Henrie</i> with the order
of Knighthood. What Ceremonies the
King then vsed it is not certainly knowen: but
before his time the custome among the <i>Saxons</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
was thus. First, hee who should receiue the
order of Knighthood, confessed himselfe in
the euening to a Priest. Then hee continued
all that night in the Church, watching and
applying himselfe to his priuate deuotions.
The next morning he heard Masse, and offered
his sword vpon the Altar. After the Gospel
was read, the sword was hallowed, and
with a benediction put about his necke. Lastly,
he communicated the mysteries of the blessed
body of Christ, and from that time remained
a lawfull Souldier or Knight. This custome
of Consecrating Knights the <i>Normans</i>
did not onely abrogate, but abhorre; not for
any euill that was therein, but because it was
not altogether their owne.</p>

<p>This yeere in a Prouince of <i>Wales</i> called
<i>Rosse</i>, the Sepulchre of <i>Wawyn</i>, otherwise called
<i>Gawen</i>, was found vpon the Sea shore.
Hee was sisters sonne to <i>Arthur</i> the great King
of the <i>Britaines</i>; a man famous in our <i>Britaine</i>
Histories, both for ciuill courtesie, and
for courage in the field. I cannot but esteeme
the report for fabulous, that his bodie was fourteene
foote in length. I doe rather coniecture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
that one credulous writer did take that for the
length of his body, which happily might bee
the length of his tombe.</p>

<p>ing <span class="smcap">William</span> the
Victor when hee drew towards
the end of his dayes,
commended the Kingdome
of <i>England</i> to his second sonne
<i>William</i>: with many blessings, with many admonitions,
with many prayers for the prosperous
successe of his succession. And because
the presence of the next successour is of greatest
moment to establish affaires, the King a
little before his passage to death, dispatched
him into <i>England</i>, with letters vnder his owne
Seale to <i>Lanfranck</i> then Archbishop of <i>Canterbury</i>:
a man highly esteemed in forraine Countreys,
but with the Cleargie and vulgare peo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>ple
of the Realme, his authoritie was absolute.
In these letters the King expressed great affection
and care towards his sonne <i>William</i>; commending
him with many kind words, for his
sufficiencies, for diuers vertues; especially for
that hee did alwayes stand firmely by him, alwayes
declare himselfe both a faithfull Subiect
and dutifull sonne. It was also coniectured by
some, that the King was guided in this choise,
no lesse by his iudgement, then by his affection:
for that he esteemed the fierce disposition of
his sonne <i>William</i> more fit to gouerne a people
not well setled in subiection, then the flexible
and milde nature of his eldest sonne <i>Robert</i>. So
<i>William</i> taking his last leaue of his father, who
was then taking his last leaue of this world,
iourneyed towards <i>England</i>; and in short time
arriued at the port called <i>Whitesand</i>, where he
receiued the first report of his fathers death.
Hereupon with all speed hee posted to <i>Lanfranck</i>,
deliuered his fathers letters, and foorthwith
was declared King, vpon the 9. day of
September, in the yere 1087. and vpon the first
of October next ensuing was by the same <i>Lanfranck</i>,
with al ceremonies and solemnities perteining
to that action, crowned at <i>Westminster</i>.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span></p>

<p><i>Robert</i>, either by negligence and want of
foresight, or by the perpetuall malice of his destinie,
or happily not without his fathers contriuance,
was absent in <i>Germanie</i>, whilest his
yonger brother <i>William</i> did thus possesse himselfe,
both of the Kingdome of his father, and
of his treasure. Otherwise he wanted neither
pretence, nor purpose, nor fauour of friends to
haue empeached his brothers proceedings. For
it was then doubted by many, and since hath
bene by many debated; whether in any case,
vpon any cause or consideration whatsoeuer,
a King hath power to disinherite his eldest
sonne, and to appoint another to succeed in
his estate.</p>

<p>That a King may aduance any of his sonnes
to bee his successour, without respect of prioritie
in birth, there seemeth to want neither
warrant of example, nor weight of authoritie.
<i>Dauid</i><a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> a man greatly prooued and approoued
by God, did preferre <i>Solomon</i><a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> to succeede him,
before his eldest sonne <i>Adonia</i>. And in like
sort <i>Rehoboam</i> the sonne of <i>Solomon</i>, appointed
the yongest of all his sonnes to succeed
him in the Kingdome.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> So some Lawyers affirme,
That a King may determine in his life,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
which of his sonnes shall reigne after him.</p>

<p>But this must be vnderstood, either when a
State is newly raised to the title of a kingdome,
or else when by Conquest, Vsurpation, or some
other meanes of change, the gouernment
thereof is newly transferred from one stemme
to another: For then because there is no certaine
Law or Custome of succession in force,
the right seemeth to depend vpon the disposition
of the Prince. And yet euen in this case,
the eldest or neerest cannot be excluded without
iust cause. For so when <i>Iacob</i><a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> depriued his
eldest sonne <i>Reuben</i> of his priuiledge of birth,
he expressed the cause, For that he had defiled
his fathers bed; which fact of his <i>Hierome</i> applieth
to the case in question. So when <i>Ptolemie</i><a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
the first King of <i>Egypt</i> commended the State to
his yongest sonne, he yeelded a reason for that
which he did. So <i>Henrie</i> the fourth Emperour,
crowned <i>Henrie</i> his yonger sonne King, reiecting
<i>Conrade</i> his eldest sonne, for that hee had
borne armes against him, and ioyned in league
with his open enemies.</p>

<p>But when by expresse Lawe or long grounded
Custome the Succession of a State is established
to the eldest sonne, the best approoued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
interpreters of the Canon and Ciuill law doe
conclude,<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> that the father hath no power to inuert
or peruert that course of order. For parents
may debarre their children of that which proceedeth
from themselues, of that which dependeth
vpon their appointment; but of that
which is due by nature,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> by the immutable law
of the State, the parents can haue no power to
dispose. When by a fundamentall Lawe or
Custome of State, Succession is annexed to the
dignity of a Crowne, according to prioritie in
birth, it followeth, that so soone as the first
borne commeth into light, the right of succession
is fixed in him;<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> not in hope onely, but also
in habite; whereof neither the father nor any
other can dispossesse him.</p>

<p>And therefore when <i>Prusias</i><a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> intended to
depriue his eldest sonne <i>Nicomedes</i> of his prerogatiue
of birth, and to preferre his yonger
sonnes, which he had by another wife, in succession
before him, he could not assure it by any
meanes, but by determining the death of
<i>Nicomedes</i>; which <i>Nicomedes</i> to preuent, dispoiled
his father both of kingdom and of life.
<i>Ptolemie</i> the first King of <i>Egypt</i><a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> of that name,
who after the death of <i>Alexander</i> the great pos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>sessed
himselfe of <i>Egypt</i>, &amp; part of <i>Arabia</i>, and
of <i>Affrick</i>, left his kingdom to the y&#333;gest of his
sons: but afterward when <i>Ptolemie</i>, surnamed
<i>Phiscon</i>,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> vpon the importunity of his wife <i>Cleopatra</i>,
attempted the like, the kingdome being
then setled in succession, the people opposed,
&amp; reuersed his order after his death. So <i>Pepine</i><a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
after hee had made seisure of the kingdome of
<i>France</i>, &amp; ordered all things which he thought
necessary for the suerty therof, disposed the succession
therein by his Testament; leauing the
Realme of <i>Noion</i> to his sonne <i>Charles</i>, and to
<i>Carloman</i> his other sonne the Realme of <i>Soissons</i>.
The like was done by some other of the
first Kings of his race. But since that time the
custome hath been strongly stablished, that the
kingdome passeth entirely to the eldest sonne,
and possessions are assigned to the rest vnder
the name of <i>Appanage</i>. And therefore the
<i>French</i><a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> writers affirme, that the eldest sonne of
<i>France</i> cannot be depriued of succession, vpon
any cause of ingratitude against his parents;
and that if the King should institute his eldest
sonne,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> yet cannot hee take the kingdome by
force of his fathers guift, but onely by the immutable
law of the Realme. Yea, <i>Girard</i> wri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>teth
of <i>Charles</i> the simple, that hee was King of
<i>France</i><a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> before hee was borne. And in this regard
the <i>Glossographer</i><a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> vpon the Decrees noteth,
that the sonne of a King may bee called
King during the life of his father, as wanting
nothing but administration. And the same also
doth <i>Seruius</i> note out of <i>Virgil</i>, where hee
saith of <i>Ascanius</i>: <i>regémq; requirunt</i>, his father
<i>Aeneas</i> being then aliue.</p>

<p>Now then, for that the right of Succession to
the Crowne of <i>England</i> was not at that time so
surely setled as it hath been since; but had waued
in long vncertainetie: First, in the <i>Heptarchie</i>
of the <i>Saxons</i> and <i>English</i>, afterward betweene
the <i>English</i> and the <i>Danes</i>, and was
then newly possessed by the <i>Normane</i>, and that
chiefly by the sword: For that also <i>Robert</i> the
Kings eldest sonne gaue iust cause of offence,
by bearing armes against his father; it may
seeme that the King might lawfully direct the
succession to his second sonne. And yet, because
as <i>Herodotus</i><a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> saith, <i>It is a generall custome amongst
all men, that the first in birth is next in succession</i>;
because as <i>Baldus</i><a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> affirmeth, <i>Semper
fuit, &amp; semper erit, &amp;c. Alwayes it hath been,
and alwayes it shall bee, that the first borne succeedeth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
in a kingdome</i>; because as S. <i>Hierome</i><a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> writeth,
<i>A kingdome is due vnto the first borne</i>; and
as S. <i>Chrysostome</i><a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> saith, <i>The first borne is to bee
esteemed more honourable then the rest</i>; whereupon
diuers Lawyers obserue, that the word
<i>Senior</i><a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> is often times taken for a Lord. Lastly,
because this precedencie both in honour, and
in right seemeth to be the Law of all nations,
deriued from the Law of Nature, and expresly
either instituted or approoued by the voice of
God: First, where he said to <i>Cain</i><a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> of his yonger
brother <i>Abel</i>; <i>His desires shall be subiect to thee,
and thou shalt haue dominion ouer him</i>: Secondly,<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
where he forbiddeth the father to disinherite
the first sonne of his double portion, because
by right of birth it is due vnto him: Lastly,
where hee maketh choice of the first borne
to be sanctified and consecrated to himselfe;<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> it
hath almost neuer happened that this order
hath been broken, that the neerest haue bene
excluded from Succession in State, but it hath
been followed with tragicall euents.</p>

<p>Yea, albeit the eldest sonne be vnfit to beare
rule, albeit hee be vnable to gouerne either others
or himselfe; as if hee be in a high degree
furious, or foolish, or otherwise defectiue in bo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>dy
or in minde, (vnlesse he degenerate from
humane condition) yet can he not therefore
be excluded from succession:<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> because it is due
vnto him, not in respect of abilitie, but by reason
of his prioritie of birth. As for the kingdom,
it shall better be preserued by the gouernment
of a Protector (as in diuers like causes it is both
vsual and fit) then by receiuing another Prince:<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
as well for other respects, as for that by cutting
off continuance in the Royall descent, by interrupting
the setled order of gouernment, by making
a breach in so high a point of State, opportunitie
is opened both for domesticall disturbances,
and for inuasions from abroad: whereupon
greater inconueniences do vsually ensue,
then did euer fall by insufficiencie of a Prince.
For if these pretenses may be allowed for good,
what aspiring Subiect, what encroaching enemy,
finding themselues furnished with meanes,
will not be ready to rise into ambitious hopes?
<i>Gabriel</i> the yonger brother of the house of <i>Saluse</i>,
kept his eldest brother in prison, vsurped
his estate, giuing foorth to the people that he
was mad. And seldome hath any vsurpation
happened, but vpon pretence of insufficiencie
in gouernment. Assuredly, if these principall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
points of Principalitie be not punctually obserued,
the ioynts of a State are loosened, the
foundation is shaken, the gates are opened for
all disorders, to rise vp, to rush in, to prosper, to
preuaile.</p>

<p>Hereupon <i>Medon</i><a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> the eldest sonne of <i>Codrus</i>,
albeit he was lame and otherwise defectiue,
was by sentence of the Oracle of <i>Apollo</i>
preferred to succeed his father in the kingdome
of <i>Athens</i>, before <i>Neleus</i> his yonger brother. So
when <i>Alexandrides</i><a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> King of <i>Sparta</i> left two
sonnes, <i>Cleomenes</i> the eldest, distracted in wits,
and <i>Doricus</i> the yongest, both able and enclined
to all actions of honour; the <i>Spartans</i> acknowledged
<i>Cleomenes</i> for their King. <i>Agisilaus</i>
the famous King of <i>Sparta</i> was also lame, as
<i>Plutarch</i><a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> and <i>Prob. Æmilius</i> do report; <i>Orosius</i>
saith, that the <i>Spartans</i> did rather choose to
haue their King halt, then their Kingdome.
And therefore when <i>Lisander</i><a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> moued them to
decree, that the worthiest and not alwayes the
next in blood of the line of <i>Hercules</i> should
reigne, he found no man to second his aduise.
<i>Aristobulus</i><a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> and <i>Hircanus</i> after a long and cruel
contention for the Kingdome of <i>Iewrie</i>,
committed their controuersie to the arbitre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>ment
of <i>Pompey</i>: <i>Hircanus</i> alledged, that hee
was the eldest brother; <i>Aristobulus</i> obiected,
that <i>Hircanus</i> was insufficient to gouerne: but
<i>Pompey</i> gaue iudgement for <i>Hircanus</i>. The
like iudgement did <i>Annibal</i><a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> giue for the kingdome
of that Countrey which is now called
<i>Sauoy</i>; restoring <i>Brancus</i><a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> to his State, from
which he had bene expelled by his yonger brother.
And although <i>Phirrus</i><a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> did appoint that
sonne to succeed, whose sword had the best
edge; yet was the eldest acknowledged, who
bare the least reputation for valour.</p>

<p><i>Ladislaus</i><a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> King of <i>Hungarie</i> left by his brother
<i>Geysa</i> two Nephewes; <i>Colomannus</i> the eldest,
who was lame, bunch-backed, crab-faced,
blunt-sighted, bleare-eyed, a dwarfe, a stammerer,
and (which is more) a Priest; and <i>Almus</i> the
yongest, a man of comely presence, and furnished
with many princely vertues: In regard of
these natural prerogatiues <i>Ladislaus</i> appointed
<i>Almus</i> to succeed; but in regard of the prerogatiue
in blood, the <i>Hungarians</i> receiued <i>Colom&#257;nus</i>
for their King. <i>Barbatius</i><a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> writeth, that <i>Galeace</i>
Duke of <i>Milane</i> did oft times expresse his
griefe, for that he could not preferre in successi&#333;
<i>Philip Maria</i> his yongest sonne, before <i>Iohn</i> his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
eldest; for that he seemed the most sufficient to
vndertake the manage of the State. <i>Girard</i><a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> affirmeth
that it hath bene the custome of the
<i>French</i>, to honour their Kings whatsoeuer they
are; whether wise or foolish, valiant or weake;
esteeming the name of King to be sacred by
whomsoeuer it be borne. And therefore they
obeyed not only <i>Charles</i> the simple, but <i>Charles</i>
the sixt also; who reigned many yeres in plaine
distraction of his mind. It was an ancient custome
in <i>Scotland</i>, that the most sufficient of the
blood of <i>Fergusus</i><a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> was receiued for King; but
such warres, murthers, and other mischiefes did
thereupon ensue, that a law was made vnder
<i>Kenet</i> the third, and afterwards confirmed by
<i>Millcolumbus</i>, that the nighest in blood should
alwayes succeede. And accordingly the Scots
refused not for their King <i>Iohn</i> the eldest sonne
of <i>Robert</i> the second, albeit he was borne out
of marriage, and did halt, and was both in wit
and in courage dull.</p>

<p>For what if he who is debarred for disabilitie
shall afterward haue a sonne free from
all defects?<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> It is without question that the
right of the Kingdome should deuolue vnto
him: for that the calamitie of parents doeth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
not preiudice their children, especially in their
naturall rights, which they may claime from
the person of former ancestors. But what if another
be in possession of the Kingdome?<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> will he
readily giue place to this right? will he readily
abandon that honour, for which men will not
spare, to climbe ouer all difficulties, to vndergoe
all dangers; to put their goods, their liues,
their soules in aduenture? If a man be once
mounted into the chaire of Maiestie, it standeth
not, I will not say with his dignitie, but
with his safetie, to betake himselfe to a priuate
State; as well for the eternall iealousie wherein
he shall be held, as for the enuie which shall be
borne against him vpon many of his actions:
So as what some few would not doe for ambition,
the same they must doe to preserue themselues.
Hereupon it will follow, that the possession
of the Kingdome being in one, and the
right in another; disunions, factions, warres
may easily ensue.</p>

<p>It is inconuenient (I grant) to be vnder a
King who is defectiue in body or in mind; but
it is a greater inconuenience, by disturbing a
setled forme of gouernment, to open an entrance
for all disorders; wherein ambition and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
insolencie (two riotous humours) may range
at large. For as euill is generally of that nature,
that it cannot stand, but by supportance of another
euill; and so multiplieth in it selfe, vntill it
doth ruine with the proper weight: so mindes
hauing once exceeded the strict bounds of obedience,
cease not to strengthen one bouldnesse
by another, vntil they haue inuolued the whole
State in confusion.</p>


<p class="p2">Bvt now to returne to the person and gouernment
of this King <i>William</i>. He was a
man of meane stature, thicke and square bodied,
his belly swelling somewhat round; his
face was red, his haire deepely yealow, by reason
whereof he was called <i>Rufus</i>; his forehead
foure square like a window, his eyes spotted and
not one like the other; his speech vnpleasant
and not easily vttered, especially when he was
mooued with anger. He was of great abilitie
in body, as well for naturall strength, as for hardinesse
to endure all ordinary extremities both
of trauaile and of want. In Armes he was both
expert and aduenturous; full of inward brauerie
and fiercenesse; neuer dismayed, alwayes
forward, and for the most part fortunate; in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
counsaile sudden, in performance a man; not
doubting to vndertake any thing which inuincible
valour durst promise to atchieue. Hee
had bene bred with the sword; alwayes in
action, alwayes on the fauourable hand of Fortune:
so as, albeit he was but yong, yet was he
in experience well grounded; for inuention
subtill, in counsaile quicke, in execution resolute;
wise to foresee a danger, and expedite to
auoid it. In a word, the generall reputation of
his valour and celeritie, made him esteemed
one of the best Chiefetaines in his time.</p>

<p>His behauiour was variable and inconstant;
earnest in euery present passion, and for the
most part accompanying the disposition of his
mind, with outward demonstrations. Of nature
he was rough, haughtie, obstinate, inuincible,
which was much enlarged both by his
soueraigntie and youth: so singular in his owne
conceit, that he did interprete it to his dishonour,
that the world should deeme, that he
did not gouerne by his owne iudgement. In
publicke he composed his countenance to a
stately terrour; his face sowerly swelling, his
eyes truculent, his voyce violent and fierce,
scarce thinking himselfe Maiesticall in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
glasse of his vnderstanding, but when he flashed
feare from his presence. And yet in priuate
he was so affable and pleasant, that he approched
neere the degree of leuitie: much giuen
to scoffing, and passing ouer many of his euill
actions with a ieast. In all the other carriages
of his life, he maintained no stable and constant
course; but declared himselfe for euery
present, as well in vertue as in vice, strong, violent, extreeme.</p>

<p>In the beginning of his reigne he was esteemed
a most accomplished Prince; and seemed
not so much of power to bridle himselfe from
vice, as naturally disposed to abhorre it. Afterwards, either
with variation of times, or yeelding
to the pleasures which prosperity vseth to
ingender euen in moderate minds, or perhaps
his nature beginning to disclose that which hee
had cunningly concealed before, corruptions
crept vp, and he waued vncertainely betweene
vertue and vice. Lastly, being imboldned by euill
teachers, and by continuance both of prosperitie
and rule, he is said to haue made his
height a priuiledge of loosenesse, and to haue
abandoned himselfe to all licentious demeanour;
wherein he seemed little to regard God,
and nothing man.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span></p>

<p>Assuredly, there is no greater enemie to
great men, then too great prosperitie in their
affaires; which taketh from them all iudgement
and rule of themselues; which maketh them ful
of libertie, and bould to doe euill. And yet I
cannot conceiue that this King was so bould, so
carelesse, so shamelesse in vices, as many writers
doe report. It is certaine that hee doubted
of some points of Religion, at that time without
any great contradiction professed; and
namely, of praying to Saints, worshipping of
Reliques, &amp; such like. It is certain also, that out
of policie in State, he endeuoured to abate the
tumorous greatnes of the Clergie at that time;
as well in riches, as in authority and power with
the people: and that he attributed not so much
to the Sea of <i>Rome</i>, as diuers Kings before him
had done. Insomuch as he restrained his subiects
from going to <i>Rome</i>, and withheld the
annuall paiment of <i>Peter</i> pence, and was oftentimes
heard to giue foorth, that <i>they follow
not the trace of <span class="f">S. Peter</span>, they greedily gape after
gifts and rewards, they retein not his power, whose
pietie they do not imitate</i>. These were causes sufficient
for the writers of his time (who were for
the most part Clergie-men) to enlarge his vi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>ces
beyond the trueth, to surmise many vices
vntruely, to wrest his true vertues to be vices.</p>

<p>And this I doe the rather coniecture, for
that I doe not find his particular actions of like
nature, with the generall imputation which is
cast vpon him; for that also I finde the chiefe
of these generall imputations to bee these:<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
<i>That he was grieuous to the Church, of no deuotion
to God, preferring respect of temporall state before
the rules of the Gospel</i>. Verely, it is hard to doe
that which will beare a cleere beauty in the
eyes of all men; and if our actions haue not
the fauour of time, and the opinion of those
men who doe estimate and report them, they
are much dimmed with disgrace.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> Out of all
doubt he was a magnanimous Prince, mercifull
and liberall, and in martiall affaires most
expert, diligent and prosperous; wise to contriue
his best aduantage, and most couragious
to atchieue it. But two things chiefly obscured
his glory; one, the incomparable greatnesse
of his father, to whom he did immediatly succeede;
the other was the prowesse of those
men, against whom he did contend in armes;
especially of <i>Malcolme</i> King of <i>Scots</i>, and of
<i>Robert</i> Duke of <i>Normandie</i>. To these I may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
adde, that hee died in the principall strength
and flourish of his age, before his iudgement
had full command ouer his courage.</p>

<p>Many doe attribute his excellent beginnings
to <i>Lanfranck</i> Archb. of <i>Canterburie</i>: who
during the time of his life, partly by authoritie,
and partly by aduise, supported the vnstable
yeeres and disposition of the King: which after
the death of <i>Lanfranck</i> returned by degrees
to their proper sway. But I do rather attribute
many of his first vertues to the troubles which
happened in the very entrance of his reigne;
which partly by employment, and partly by
feare, held his inclination in some restraint. For
<i>Odo</i> Bishop of <i>Baion</i> and Earle of <i>Kent</i>, the
Kings vncle by the mothers side, had drawen
the greatest part of all the Prelates and Nobilitie
that were <i>Normans</i>, into a dangerous confederacie
against the King; to deiect him from
his State, and to aduance <i>Robert</i> his elder brother
for their King.</p>

<p>The secret cause of this conspiracie was partly
vpon a generall discontentment, at the great,
though worthy estimation and authoritie (a
most capitall offence in the eye of enuie) of
<i>Lanfrank</i> Archbishop of <i>Canterburie</i>; by means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
whereof many of the conspirators liued in farre
meaner reputation, then their ambitious minds
could easily breake: but chiefly it was vpon a
more particular grudge, which <i>Odo</i> did beare against
the same <i>Lanfranck</i>; because by his perswasion,
<i>Odo</i> had been committed to prison by
King <i>William</i> the elder. For when the King
complained to <i>Lanfranck</i> of the intolerable
both auarice and ambition of his brother <i>Odo</i>,
the Archbishop gaue aduise, that hee should
bee restrained of his libertie. And when the
King doubted, how he being a Bishop, might
be committed to prison, without impeaching
the priuiledges of the Church; indeede answered
<i>Lanfranck</i>, you may not imprison the Bishop
of <i>Baion</i>, but you may doe what you
please with the Earle of <i>Kent</i>.</p>

<p>The publike and open pretenses were these.
<i>Robert</i> Duke of <i>Normandie</i> had the prerogatiue
of birth; which being a benefit proceeding
from nature, could not bee reuersed by his fathers
acte. He had also wonne a most honorable
reputation for his militarie vertues; and
had by many trauels of warre wasted the wilde
follies of youth. Hee was no lesse famous for
courtesie and liberalitie, two most amiable or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>naments
of honour; being so desirous that no
man should depart discontented from him,
that he would oftentimes promise more then
hee was able to performe, and yet performe
more then his estate could expediently afford.
As for K. <i>William</i>, besides that he was the yonger
brother, his nature was held to be doubtfull
and suspect, and the iudgement of most
men enclined to the worst. And what are we
then aduantaged, (said they) by the death of
his father? if whom he hath fleeced, this shall
flay; if this shall execute those whom he hath
fettered and surely bound; If after his seuerities
that are past, wee shall be freshly charged
with those rigours, which tyrants in the height
and pride of their Fortune are wont to vse?
And as stronger combinations are alwayes
made betweene men drawne together by one
common feare, then betweene those that are
ioyned by hope or desire; so vpon these iealousies
and feares, accompanied also with vehement
desires, the Confederats supposed that
they had knit a most assured league.</p>

<p>Now it happened that at the time of the
death of <i>William</i> the elder, <i>Robert</i> his eldest
sonne was absent in <i>Almaine</i>; and at once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
heard both of the death of his father, and that
his brother <i>William</i> was acknowledged to be
King. Hereupon in great hast, but greater
heat both of anger and ambition, he returned
into <i>Normandie</i>: and there whilest he was breathing
foorth his discontentment and desire of
reuenge, he receiued a message from the Confederats
in <i>England</i>; that with all speed hee
should come ouer vnto them, to accomplish
the enterprise, to furnish their forces with a
head: that they had no want of able bodies;
they wanted no meanes to maintaine them
together; they wanted onely his person both to
countenance and conduct them. The Duke
thought it no wisdome, to aduenture himselfe
altogether; vpon the fauour and faith of discontented
persons: and he had bene so loosely
liberall before, that he was vnprouided of money,
to appoint himselfe with any competent
forces of his owne. Hereupon he pawned a
part of <i>Normandie</i> to his brother <i>Henry</i>, for
waging Souldiers: many also flocked voluntarily
vnto him; vpon inducement, that hee
who of his owne nature was most liberall &amp; full
of humanitie, would not faile both of pay and
reward, vnlesse by reason of disabilitie &amp; want.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span></p>

<p>In the meane time the Confederats resolued
to breake forth in Armes, in diuers parts of the
Realme at once; vpon conceit, that if the King
should endeuour to represse them in one place,
they might more easily preuaile in the other.
And so accordingly <i>Odo</i> fortified and spoiled
in <i>Kent</i>; <i>Geoffrey</i> Bishop of <i>Exceter</i>, with his
nephew <i>Robert Mowbray</i> Earle of <i>Northumberland</i>,
at <i>Bristow</i>; <i>Roger Montgomerie</i> in <i>Northfolke</i>,
<i>Suffolke</i> and <i>Cambridgeshire</i>; <i>Hugh de
Grandemenill</i>, in <i>Leicestershire</i> and <i>Northamptonshire</i>;
<i>William</i> Bishop of <i>Durhame</i>, in the North
parts of the Realme; diuers others of the Clergie
and Nobilitie in <i>Herefordshire</i>, <i>Shropshire</i>,
<i>Worcestershire</i>, and all the Countreys adioyning
to <i>Wales</i>. And as in time of pestilence all
diseases turne to the plague; so in this generall
tumult, all discontentments sorted to Rebellion.
Many who were oppressed with violence or
with feare; many who were kept lower either
by want or disgrace then they had set their
mounting minds, adioyned daily to the side,
and encreased both the number and the hope.
And thus was all the Realme in a ruinous rage
against K. <i>William</i>, who wanted neither courage
to beare, nor wisdome to decline it.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span></p>

<p>And first hee endeuoured by all meanes to
make the <i>English</i> assured vnto him. And albeit
few of them were at that time in any great
place, either of credite or of charge, but were
all wounded by his fathers wrongs; yet for
that they were the greatest part, he made the
greatest reckoning of them. For this cause hee
released many <i>English</i> Lords who had bene
committed to custodie by his father. He composed
himselfe to courtesie and affabilitie towards
the people, and distributed much treasure
among them. But especially hee wanne
their inclination by promises of great assurance,
to restore vnto them their ancient lawes,
to ease them of tributes and taxations, and to
permit them free libertie of hunting: which being
their principall pleasure and exercise before,
was either taken away, or much restrained
from them by King <i>William</i> the elder. Herewith
he applied himselfe to appease the mutinous
minds of his Nobilitie, to seuer the Confederats,
to breake the faction; to diuide it
first, and thereby to defeat it.</p>

<p>To this purpose he dealt with <i>Roger Montgomerie</i>,
who next vnto <i>Odo</i> was a principall
both countenance and strength to the reuolt;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
he dealt also with diuers others, inferiour vnto
him in authority and degree; that he could not
coniecture for what cause they were so violent
against him: did they want money? His fathers
treasure was at their deuotion: desired
they encrease of possessions? they should not
be otherwise bounded then by their owne desires:
that hee would willingly also giue ouer
his estate, in case it should be iudged expedient
by themselues, whom his father had put in
trust to support him: that they should doe wel
to foresee, whether by ouerthrowing his fathers
iudgement in appointing the kingdome vnto
him, they should not doe that which might be
preiudiciall to themselues; for the same man
who had appointed him to bee King, had also
conferred vnto them those honours and possessions
which they held. Thus sometimes
dealing priuately with particulars, and sometimes
with many together, and eftsoones filling
them with promises and hopes, and that with
such new vehemencie of words as they beleeued
could not proceede from dissembled intents;
he so preuailed in the end, that hereby,
and by example of some inducing the rest, <i>Roger
Montgomerie</i> and diuers others were recon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>ciled
to the King; in whom was thought to rest
no smal matter to hold vp the reputation of the
enterprise.</p>

<p>And further, hee prepared a nauie to guard
the seas, and to impeach the passage of his
brother into <i>England</i>. Hee prepared great forces
also by meanes of the treasure which his father
had left, and disposed them in places conuenient,
either to preuent or to represse these
scattered tumults. But the successe of his affaires
was by no meanes so much aduanced, as
by <i>Lanfranck</i> Archbishop of <i>Canterbury</i>, and
by <i>Woolstane</i> Bishop of <i>Worcester</i>: the authority
of which two men, the one for his learning,
wisedome, and mild moderation, the other for
his simple sanctitie and integritie of life, was
greatly regarded by all sorts of people. By encouragement
of <i>Woolstane</i> not onely the citie
of <i>Worcester</i> was maintained in firme condition
for the King, but his enemies receiued there a
famous foyle; the greatest part being slaine,
and the residue dispersed. This was the first
sad blow which the confederates tooke; afterward
they declined mainely, and the King as
mainly did increase.</p>

<p>The King in person led his chiefe forces in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>to
<i>Kent</i>, against <i>Odo</i> his vncle, the principall
firebrand of all this flame. Hee tooke there the
castle of <i>Tunbridge</i> and of <i>Pemsey</i>, which <i>Odo</i>
had fortified; and lastly hee besieged <i>Odo</i> himselfe
in the castle of <i>Rochester</i>, and with much
trauell tooke him prisoner, and compelled him
to abiure the Realme. Vpon these euents, the
Bishop of <i>Durham</i>, aduising onely with feare
and despaire, fled out of the Realme; but after
three yeeres he was againe restored to the dignitie
of his Sea. The residue did submit themselues
to the Kings discretion; and were by him
receiued, all to pardon, some to gracious and
deare account. For in offences of so high nature,
pardon neuer sufficeth to assure offenders,
vnlesse by further benefits their loyaltie bee
bound.</p>

<p><i>Robert</i> Duke of <i>Normandy</i> was busied all
this time, in making preparation for his iourney
into <i>England</i>: but his delayes much abated
the affections of those who fauoured either his
person or cause. At the length, hauing made
vp a competent power, he committed to sea;
where, his infelicities concurring with his negligence,
diuers of his ships which he had sent
somewhat before him, to assure the confederats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
of his approach, were set vpon and surprised by
the nauie of King <i>William</i>. After this hee arriued
in <i>England</i>, sent vnto many of his secret
friends, and made his comming knowen vnto
all: but no man resorted to him, he receiued
no aduertisement from any man; but
plainely found, that by the fortunate celeritie
of King <i>William</i>, the heart of the conspiracie in
all places was broken. So the Duke returned
into <i>Normandie</i>, hauing then good leisure, to
looke into the errour of his leisurely proceedings.</p>

<p>When the King had in this sort either wisely
reconciled, or valiantly repressed his domesticall
enemies; because an vnperfect victory is
alwayes the seede of a new warre, he followed
his brother with a mighty armie, and remoued
the seate of the warre into <i>Normandie</i>. For he
coniectured (as in trueth it fell out) that the
Duke his brother vpon his returne, would presently
disperse his companies, for want of money;
and for the same cause would not easily
be able to draw them together againe. So his
valour and his power being much aduantaged
by his sudden comming, ioyned to the
want of foresight and preparation in the Duke;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
he tooke in short time the Castles of <i>Walerick</i>
and <i>Aubemarle</i>, with the whole Countrey of
<i>Eu</i>; the Abbacie of <i>Mount S Michael</i>, <i>Fescampe</i>,
<i>Chereburge</i>, and diuers other places; which he
furnished with men of Armes, and Souldiers
of assured trust.</p>

<p>The Duke feeling his owne weakenesse,
dealt with <i>Philip</i> King of <i>France</i>, and by liberall
promises so preuailed with him, that he descended
into <i>Normandie</i> with a faire Armie, and
bent his siege against one of those pieces which
K. <i>William</i> had taken. But he found it so knottie
a piece of worke, that in short time wearied
with hardnesse and hazards of the field, he fell
to a capitulation with King <i>William</i>, and so departed
out of <i>Normandie</i>; receiuing a certaine
summe of money in regard of his charges, and
conceiuing that he had won honour ynough,
in that no honour had bene won against him.</p>

<p>The money that was payd to the King of
<i>France</i>, was raised in <i>England</i> by this deuise.
King <i>William</i> commanded that 20. Thousand
men should be mustered in <i>England</i>, and transported
into <i>Normandie</i>, to furnish his warres
against the <i>French</i>. When they were conducted
neere to <i>Hastings</i>, and almost ready to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
embarked, it was signified to them from the
King; that aswell for their particular safeties, as
not to disfurnish the Realme of strength, whosoeuer
would pay 10. shillings towards the
waging of Souldiers in <i>Normandie</i>, he might
be excused to stay at home. Among 20. Thousand
scarce any was found, who was not ioyfull
to embrace the condition; who was not
ready to redeeme his aduenture with so small a
summe: which being gathered together, was
both a surer and easier meanes to finish the
warres, then if the King had still struggeled by
force of Armes. For when the <i>French</i> King had
abandoned the partie, Duke <i>Robert</i>, being prepared
neither with money, nor constancie of
mind to continue the warre, enclined to peace;
which at the last, by diligence of friends, was
concluded betweene the two brothers, vpon
these conditions.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>That the Duke should yeeld to the King the
Countie of <span class="f">Eu</span>, the Abbey of <span class="f">Fescampe</span>, the Abbey
of <span class="f">S. Michaels mount</span>, <span class="f">Chereburge</span>, and all other
Castles and fortifications which the King
had taken.</i></p>

<p><i>That the King should subdue to the vse of the
Duke, all other Castles and houldes, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
had reuolted from him in <span class="f">Normandie</span>.</i></p>

<p><i>That the King should giue to the Duke certaine
dignities and possessions in <span class="f">England</span>.</i></p>

<p><i>That the King should restore all those to their
dignities and lands in <span class="f">England</span>, who had taken
part with the Duke against him.</i></p>

<p><i>That if either of them should die without issue
male, the suruiuour should succeed in his estate.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>These Articles were confirmed by twelue Barons
on the Kings part, and as many on the
part of the Duke; so long obserued, as either
of them wanted either power or pretence to
disanull them.</p>

<p>This peace being made, the Duke vsed the
aide of King <i>William</i>, to recouer the fort of
<i>Mount S. Michael</i>, which their brother <i>Henrie</i>
did forceably hold, for the money which hee
had lent to the Duke of <i>Normandie</i>. Fourtie
dayes they layed siege to this castle; hauing no
hope to carrie it, but by the last necessity, which
is hunger. Within the compasse of this time,
as the King straggled alone vpon the shoare,
certaine horsemen salied foorth and charged
vpon him; of whom three strooke him together
so violently with their lances, as because he
could not be driuen out of his saddle, together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
with his saddle he was cast vpon the ground,
and his horse slaine vpon the place, for which
he had payed the same day 15. markes. Extremitie
of danger (as it often happeneth) tooke
from the King all feare of danger: wherefore
taking vp his saddle with both his hands, he did
therewith defend himselfe for a time. But because
to stand vpon defence onely is alwayes
vnsure, he drew his sword, and would not depart
one foot from his saddle; but making shew
of braue ioy, that he had nothing to trust vnto
but his owne valour, he defended both his
saddle and himselfe, till rescue came. Afterward
when some of his Souldiers in blaming
maner expostulated with him, wherefore he
was so obstinate to saue his saddle: his answere
was, that a King should loose nothing which
he can possibly saue: <i>It would haue angred mee</i>,
(said he) <i>at the very heart, that the knaues
should haue bragged, that they had wonne the
saddle from mee</i>. And this was one of his perpetuall
felicities, to escape easily out of desperate
dangers.</p>

<p>In the end <i>Henry</i> grew to extreeme want of
water, and other prouisions: by which meanes
he was ready to fall into the hands of those,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
who desired to auoyd necessitie to hurt him.
And first he sent to the Duke his brother, to request
some libertie to take in fresh water. The
Duke sent to him a tunne of wine, and granted
a surcease of hostilitie for one day, to furnish
him with water. At this the King seemed discontented,
as being a meanes to prolong the
warre. But the Duke told him, that it had bene
hard to deny a brother a little water for his necessitie.
Herewith likewise the King relenting,
they sent for their brother <i>Henry</i>; and wisdome
preuailing more then iniuries or hate, they fell
to an agreement, That vpon a day appointed,
<i>Henry</i> should receiue his money at <i>Roan</i>; and
that in the meane time, hee should hold the
countrey of <i>Constantine</i> in morgage. The King
enterteined with pay many of his brother
<i>Henries</i> souldiers; especially he receiued those
who ouerthrew him, to a very neere degree of
fauour. And thus all parties ordered their ambition
with great modestie; the custome of
former warres running in a course of more humanitie,
then since they haue done.</p>

<p>The King was the more desirous to perfect
these agreements of Peace, for that <i>Malcolme</i>
King of <i>Scots</i> (as Princes often times make vse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
of the contentions of their neighbours) tooke
occasion vpon these confusions, to enterprise
vp&#333; the parts of <i>England</i> which confined vpon
him. So as he inuaded <i>Northumberland</i>, made
great spoile, tooke much prey, caried away many
prisoners; whose calamitie was the more miserable,
for that they were to endure seruitude
in a hard Countrey. For this cause the King
with his accustomed celeritie returned into
<i>England</i>, accompanied with the Duke of <i>Normandie</i>
his brother; and led a mighty armie against
the <i>Scots</i> by land, and sent also a nauie
to infest them by sea. But by a sudden and
stiffe storme, by a hideous confusion of all ill
disposed weather, his ships were cruelly crushed;
and hauing long wrought against the
violence and rage of the tempest, were in the
end dispersed, and diuers of them cast away.
Many of his souldiers also perished, partly by
penurie and want, and partly by the euill qualitied
ayre.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the <i>Scots</i>, knowing the
King of <i>England</i> to bee an enemie mighty and
resolute, began to wauer in their assurance;
framing fearefull opinions, of the number, valour
and experience of his armie. Hereupon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
some ouertures of peace were made; the
<i>Scots</i> expecting that the King, by reason of his
late losses, would be the more moderate in his
demands. But hee then shewed himselfe most
resolute and firme; following his naturall custome,
not to yeelde to any difficulty. King
<i>Malcolme</i> coniecturing that such confidence
could not be without good cause, consented at
the last to these conditions.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>That King <span class="f">Malcolme</span> should make a certaine
satisfaction for the spoyles which hee had done in
<span class="f">England</span>.</i></p>

<p><i>That King <span class="f">William</span> should restore to him certaine
lands in <span class="f">England</span>.</i></p>

<p><i>That K. <span class="f">Malcolme</span> should doe homage to King
<span class="f">William</span>.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Now the day was come wherein <i>Henrie</i> was
appointed to receiue his money at <i>Roan</i>, from
the Duke of <i>Normandie</i>. But as affaires of
Princes haue great variations, so they are not
alwayes constant in their Counsels. And so the
Duke, caried by his occasions, and ready to
lay downe his faith and word more to the
traine of times, then to the preseruation of his
honour; instead of paying the money, committed
his brother <i>Henry</i> to prison: from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
whence he could not be released, vntill hee renounced
the Countie of <i>Constantine</i>, and
bound himselfe by oath neuer to claime any
thing in <i>Normandie</i>.</p>

<p><i>Henrie</i> complained hereof to <i>Philip</i> King of
<i>France</i>; who gaue him a faire enterteinement
in his Court, but was content rather to feede
then finish the contention: either expecting
thereby some opportunitie to himselfe, or els
the opinion of his owne greatnesse not suffring
him to feare, that others might grow to haue
fortune against him. <i>Henry</i> had not long remained
in the Court of <i>France</i>, but a <i>Normane</i>
Knight named <i>Hacharde</i> conueyed him disguised
into <i>Normandie</i>; where the Castle of
<i>Damfronç</i> was deliuered vnto him; and in
short time after hee gate all the Countrey of
<i>Passays</i>, and a good part of <i>Constantine</i>; either
without resistance, or without difficultie and
perill.</p>

<p>Hereupon the Duke leuied his forces, and
earnestly assayed to recouer <i>Damfronç</i>: but
then hee found that his brother <i>Henrie</i> was secretly,
yet surely vnderset by the king of <i>England</i>.
Hereupon, incensed with the furie of an
iniuried minde, hee exclaimed against his bro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>ther
of <i>England</i>, and almost proclaimed him a
violator of his league. On the other side, the
King of <i>England</i> iustified his action, for that hee
was both a meanes and a partie to the agreement:
and therefore stood bound in honour,
not onely to vrge, but to enforce performance.
So the flame brake foorth more furious then it
was before, and ouer went King <i>William</i> with
an able armie; where hee found the Duke also
in good condition of strength commanding
the field. And albeit in so neere approach
of two mighty enemies, equall both in ambition
and power, it is hard to conteine men of seruice;
yet was nothing executed betweene
them, but certaine light skirmishes, and surprizements
of some places of defence. In the
end, the King hearing of new troubles in <i>England</i>,
and the Duke finding himselfe vnable either
to preuaile with few souldiers, or to maintaine
many, and both distrusting to put a speedie
end to the warre; they were easily drawne
to capitulations of peace. And thus ended the
contention betweene these brethren; who vntill
this time had continued like the waues of
the Sea, alwayes in motion, and one beating against
the other.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span></p>

<p>Besides these businesses which befell the
King, against his Nobilitie, against the Duke of
<i>Normandie</i> his brother, and against the King
and nation of the <i>Scots</i>; the <i>Welshmen</i> also (who
alwayes struggled for libertie and reuenge)
perceiuing that the King was often absent, and
much entangled with hostile affaires; enforced
the fauour of that aduantage, to free themselues
from subiection of the <i>English</i>, and happily
to enlarge or enrich themselues vpon
them. So hauing both desire and opportunitie,
they wanted not meanes to assemble in armes,
to expell the <i>English</i> that were amongst them,
and to cast downe the Castles erected in their
Countrey, as the principall yoakes of their subiection.
Afterwards, rising in boldnesse with
successe, they made diuers incursions vpon the
bordering parts of <i>England</i>; spoiled the Citie of
<i>Glocester</i>, and exercised all those outrages,
which vnciuill people, incensed both with want
and with hate doe not vsually omit. But being
a company neither in discipline nor pay, raw
and vnarmed, they proceeded more like to
robbers then to Souldiers; hauing no intention
to vanquish, but to spoile.</p>

<p>Hereupon the King twice in person inua<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>ded
<i>Wales</i>, but with small shew of successe for
the present. For the <i>Welsh</i>-enemies scattered
the warre, by diuiding themselues into small
companies, and retiring into the mountaines
and woods, and other places of naturall defence.
Here they trauailed the King with a fugitiue
fight; flying when they were pursued,
and houering vpon him when they were giuen
ouer: cutting off many stragling souldiers,
and taking some carriages, which in those
rough places could not easily either be passed,
or defended. And so by shifting alwayes into
places of aduantage, they sought at one time,
both to auoyd fighting, and to hinder the King
from doing any thing of importance. At the
last, the King hauing made sufficient proofe
how vaine it is, to follow a light footed enemie
with a heauie Armie, pestered with traine of
carriage, in places where the seruice of horsemen
is almost vnprofitable; he gaue ouer the
pursuit, and retired into <i>England</i>. But first he
repaired those Castles which the <i>Welsh</i> had destroyed,
and built new Castles also vpon the
frontiers and within the bosome of <i>Wales</i>;
which he furnished with so sure garrisons, as
might suffice with fauour of opportunitie, ei<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>ther
to weary or consume the enemies.</p>

<p>And indeed the <i>Welsh</i> being by this meanes,
alwayes exercised, and dayly wasted; declined
in short time, no lesse to cowardise then to
wearinesse and wants; so as <i>Hugh</i> Earle of <i>Chester</i>,
&amp; <i>Hugh</i> Earle of <i>Shrewesbury</i>, dispossessed
them of the Isle of <i>Anglesey</i>, which they had surprised
not long before. The <i>Welsh</i> that were
there taken, were very hardly, or rather vnmercifully
and cruelly entreated; Some had their
eyes pulled out, some their hands cut off, some
their armes, some their noses, some their genitalles.
An aged Priest named <i>Kenredus</i>, who
had bene a chiefe directer of the common affaires,
was drawne out of a Church whereinto
he had fled, had one of his eyes pulled out, and
his tongue torne from his throat. I make no
doubt but these seuerities were vsed against
them, vpon some sauage outrages which they
had done; wherein the lesse compassion was
borne to their calamities, for the cowardise
which they shewed in their owne defence.</p>

<p>Shortly after, <i>Magnus</i> King of <i>Norway</i> the
sonne of <i>Olaus</i>, the sonne of <i>Harold Harfager</i>,
hauing brought the Isles of <i>Orkeney</i> vnder his
dominion, subdued also from the <i>Welsh</i> the Isle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
of <i>Man</i>; and enterprised vpon the Isle of <i>Anglesey</i>
against the <i>English</i>. But at his landing he was
encountred by the Earle of <i>Shrewsbury</i> and the
Earle of <i>Chester</i>; in which fight the <i>Norwegians</i>
were vanquished and repelled, but the Earle
of <i>Shrewsbury</i> with too braue boldnesse lost his
life: leauing his honourable both actions and
end as an excellent ornament to his posteritie.
Afterwards the Earle of <i>Chester</i> led an armie into
<i>Wales</i>; and found the people so consumed
by the <i>English</i> garisons, that he easily reduced
many to professe obedience to the Crowne of
<i>England</i>; and disabled others, hauing no leaders
of experience and valour, for shewing
their faces as enemies in the field.</p>

<p>Also vpon some variances which did rise
betweene <i>Iustinus</i>, sonne to <i>Gurguntus</i>, Earle
of <i>Glamorgane</i> and <i>Morganock</i>; and <i>Rhesus</i>
sonne to <i>Theodore</i> Prince of Southwales: <i>Iustinus</i>,
not of power to maintaine either his
right or his will, sent <i>Æneas</i>, sonne to <i>Genidorus</i>,
sometimes Lord of <i>Demetia</i>, to craue aide
in <i>England</i>. This he obtained, not onely readily,
but in greater measure then the seruice
did require. <i>Robert Fitzhamond</i> was generall
Commander of the <i>English</i> armie; who en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>countred
<i>Rhesus</i> at a place called <i>Blackhill</i>;
and in that fight <i>Rhesus</i> was slaine: after whose
death the name of King ceased in <i>Wales</i>. Then
<i>Iustinus</i> failing, and happily not able to performe
such conditions as in necessitie hee had
assured, <i>Fitzhamond</i> turned his forces against
him; chased the <i>Welsh</i> out of the champaine
Countrey, and diuided the same among his
principall Gentlemen. These erected Castles,
in places conuenient for their mutuall ayde;
and so well defended themselues, that they left
the Countrey to their posterity. Thus was the
Lordship of <i>Glamorgane</i> and <i>Morganock</i>, which
conteineth 27. miles in length, &amp; 22. in bredth,
subdued to the <i>English</i>; giuing example how
dangerous it is for any people, to call in a greater
force of strangers to their ayde, then being
victorious, they may easily be able to limit and
restraine. This being a Lordship marcher,
hath enioyed royall liberties, since the time
wherein it was first subdued. It hath acknowledged
seruice and obedience onely to the
Crowne. It hath had the triall of all actions,
as well reall as personall, and also held Pleas of
the Crowne; with authority to pardon all offences,
Treason onely excepted.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span></p>

<p>Whilest the King was entertained with
these chases, rather then warres in <i>Wales</i>, hee
lay at <i>Gloucester</i> many times; as not esteeming
that his presence should alwayes be necessary,
and yet not farre off if occasion should require.
To this place <i>Malcolme</i> King of <i>Scots</i> came vnto
him, vpon an honourable visitation. But the
King hauing conceiued some displeasure against
him, refused to admit him to his presence.
Hereupon King <i>Malcolme</i>, full of fury
and disdaine, returned into <i>Scotland</i>, assembled
an armie, enuaded <i>Northumberland</i>, harrased
and spoyled a great part thereof; hauing done
the like foure times before. Such is the heate
of hate in mindes that are mighty; who seldome
hold it any breach of Iustice, to bee reuenged
of him who offereth dishonor. When
he was come neere to <i>Alnewicke</i>, and his souldiers
were much pestered with prey, (a notable
impediment both for readinesse and resolution
to fight) hee was set vpon both suddenly and
sharply by <i>Robert Mowbray</i> Earle of <i>Northumberland</i>;
his troupes hewen in pieces, himselfe
together with his eldest sonne <i>Edward</i> slaine.
The third day ensuing, <i>Margaret</i> wife to King
<i>Malcolme</i>, and sister to <i>Edgar Adeling</i>, not able<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
to beare so sad and heauie a blow of fortune,
ended also her life. Shee was famous for pietie
and for modestie, two excellent endowments
of that Sexe. By her perswasion <i>Malcolme</i>
made a law, that whereas by a former law
made by King <i>Eugenius</i>, the Lord enioyed the
first night with any new married woman within
his dominion; the husband might redeeme
that abuse by paiment of halfe a mark of siluer.</p>

<p>King <i>Malcolme</i> being slaine, <i>Dunwald</i> his
brother vsurped the kingdome; but after a few
dayes he was dispossessed thereof by <i>Duncane</i>,
bastard son to K. <i>Malcolme</i>. In this action <i>Duncane</i>
was chiefly supported by the King of <i>England</i>;
with whom he had remained in hostage,
and to whom hee had made his submission by
oath. And because the <i>Scots</i> did either see or
suspect that hee bare a fauourable affection to
the <i>English</i>, they would not receiue him for
their King, but vnder promise that hee should
not entertaine any <i>English</i> or <i>Normane</i>, either
in place of seruice, or as a follower at large. The
yeere next following <i>Duncane</i> was slaine, and
<i>Dunwald</i> was againe possessed of the kingdom.
Hereupon King <i>William</i> sent <i>Clito Edgar</i> with
an armie into <i>Scotland</i>; by whose meanes <i>Dunwald</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
was dispoiled againe of his Kingdome,
and <i>Edgar</i> sonne to King <i>Malcolme</i> aduanced
to his fathers estate.</p>

<p>These were the principall aduentures by
Armes which concerned <i>England</i>, during the
reigne of K. <i>William</i> the second: wherein he so
behaued himselfe, that he did worthily winne
an opinion to be one, who both knew and
durst. In all actions hee esteemed himselfe
greatly dishonoured, if hee were not both in
Armes with the first, and with the forwardest
in fight; doing double seruice, as well by example,
as by direction: In which heate of valour,
the fauour of his Fortune excused many
of his attempts from the blame of rashnesse.
He was oftentimes most constant, or rather obstinate
in pursuing those purposes, which with
small deliberation he vndertooke.</p>

<p>At a certaine time when he was in hunting
within the new Forrest, he receiued aduertisement,
that <i>Mans</i> was surprised by <i>Helie</i>, Count
<i>de la Flesch</i>, who pretended title thereto in right
of his wife: that he was aided in this enterprise
by <i>Fouques d'Angiers</i>, an ancient enemie to the
Dukes of <i>Normandie</i>: and that the castle which
held good for the King, must also be rendered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
if in very short time it were not relieued. Vpon
these newes, as if he had bene in the heat of a
chase, he presently turned his horse; and his
passion not staying to consult with reason, in
great haste roade towards the Sea. And when
he was aduised by some to stay a time, and take
with him such forces as the importance of the
seruice did require; with a heart resolute and
violent voice he answered, <i>That they who loued
him, would not faile to follow; and that if no man
else would stirre, he alone would relieue Mans</i>.</p>

<p>When he came to <i>Dortmouth</i>, he commanded
ships to be brought for his passage. The
winds were then both contrary and stiffe, and
the Sea swelled exceeding bigge; for which
cause the Shipmasters perswaded him to await
a more fauourable season, and not to cast himselfe
vpon the miserable mercie of that storme.
Notwithstanding the King, whose feare was alwayes
least when dangers were greatest, mounted
vpon Shipboard, and commanded them to
put to Sea; affirming, That it was no Prince-like
mind to breake a iourney for foulenesse of
weather; and that he neuer heard of any King
that had bene drowned. And so for that the
chiefe point of rescue rested in expedition, hee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
presently committed to Sea; taking few with
him, and leauing order that others should follow.
After hee had long wrastled with the
winds and waues, he arriued in <i>France</i>, where
running on in the humour of his courage and
forwardnesse, he acquitted himselfe with greater
honour then at any time before. So effectuall
is celeritie for the benefit of a seruice, that
oftentimes it more auaileth, then either multitude
or courage of Souldiers.</p>

<p>In this expedition, <i>Helie</i> the principall commander
against him was taken. And when he
was brought to the Kings presence, the King
said pleasantly vnto him: <i>Ah master! in faith I
haue you now; and I hope I shal be able to keepe you
in quiet</i>. Then he: <i>It is true indeed, the successe
of my attempts haue not bene answerable to the resolution
of my minde; by meere aduenture now you
haue me: but if I were at libertie againe, I doe better
know what I had to doe, and would not so easily
be held in quiet</i>. The King with a braue scorne
replied: <i>I see thou art but a foolish knaue; vnable
to vse, either thy libertie or thy restreint aright.
But goe thy wayes, make good thy confidence: I
set thee free and at libertie againe; vse thy aduantage,
and doe thy worst</i>. <i>Helie</i> daunted more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
with this high courage, then before he had bin
with the victory of the King, submitted himselfe,
and made his peace vnder such conditions
as it pleased the King to lay vpon him.
Certainely this magnanimous example hath
seldome bin equalled, neuer excelled by those,
who are admired for the principall worthies
of the world.</p>

<p>He little fauoured flatterers; the flies which
blow corruption vpon sweetest vertues; the
myrie dogs of the Court, who defile Princes
with fawning on them; who commonly are
fatted with bread which is made with the
teares of miserable people. He was most firme
and assured in his word: and to those who did
otherwise aduise him, he would say; That <i>God
did stand obliged by his word</i>.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>He is commended for his manly mercie; in
releasing prisoners, and in pardoning offences
of highest qualitie: which to a people that then
liued vnder a Law, both rigorous, and almost
arbitrarie, and (as well for the noueltie as for
the vncertaintie thereof) in a manner vnknowne,
was a most high valued vertue. He
not onely pardoned many great offenders, but
partly by gifts, and partly by aduancements he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
knit them most assuredly vnto him. And therefore
although in the beginning of his reigne,
most of the Nobilitie, and many Gentlemen of
best quality and rancke endeuoured to displace
him, and to set vp <i>Robert</i> his elder brother for
their King; yet doeth it not appeare, either
that any seueritie was executed vpon them, or
that afterward they were dangerous vnto him.
Notwithstanding in some actions he was noted
of crueltie, or at the least of sharpnesse and
seuerity in iustice. For albeit hee promised to
the <i>English</i>, whilest his first feares and iealousies
continued, that they should enioy free
libertie of hunting; yet did hee afterwards so
seuerely restraine it, that the penalty for killing
a Deere was death.</p>

<p><i>Robert Mowbray</i> Earle of <i>Northumberland</i>,
after he had defeated the <i>Scots</i> and slaine <i>Malcolme</i>
their King, not finding himselfe either
honoured or respected according to his seruice;
first refrained, and afterwards refused to come
vnto the Court. Hereupon the King, ouerruled
indifferently with suspition and hate, (two violent
passions in minds placed in authoritie) sent
his brother <i>Henry</i> with an armie against him;
who spoyled the Countrey, tooke the Earle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
and committed him to prison. Then was hee
charged with diuers crimes, which were sufficient
(although but surmised) to vndoe an Innocent.
Many examinations were also made,
but for appearance onely and terrour, not to any
bottome or depth. The especiall matter
obiected against him was, for contriuing to despoyle
the King both of life and state, and to set
vp <i>Stephen Albamerle</i> his Aunts sonne for King.
And thus it often happeneth, that great deserts
are occasions to men of their destruction; either
because Princes generally loue not those to
whom they are exceedingly beholding, or else
for that thereby men doe grow proud, insolent,
disdainefull, bould, immoderate both in expectation
and demand, discontented, impatient
if they be not satisfied, and apt to breake forth
into dangerous attempts.</p>

<p>Of those who any wayes declared themselues
in his fauour or defence; some were despoiled
of their goods, some were banished the
Realme; others were punished with losse of
their eyes, or of their eares, or of some other
part of their bodie. <i>William d'Owe</i> was accused
in a Councell holden at <i>Salisbury</i>, to bee a
complice of this Treason. And albeit he chal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>lenged
his accuser to the combate, yet his eyes
were pulled out, and his stones cut off by commandement
of the King. And yet some authours
affirme, that he was ouercome in combate
before. For the same cause the King commanded
<i>William Aluerie</i> to be hanged; a man
of goodly personage and modest behauiour;
the Kings sewer, his Aunts sonne, and his godfather.
Before his execution hee desired to be
whipped through manie Churches in <i>London</i>:
he distributed his garments to the poore, and
bloodied the street as he went, with often kneeling
vpon the stones. At the time of his death
he tooke it vpon the charge of his soule, that he
was cleere of the offence for which he suffered.
And so committing his innocencie to God,
and to the world his complaints, he submitted
himselfe to the Executioners hands: leauing an
opinion in some, a suspition in many, that others
also died without desert. For the king
gaue an easie eare to any man, that would appeach
others for his aduantage: whereby it
sometimes happened, that offenders were acquited
by accusing innocents.</p>

<p>He was liberall aboue measure; either in regard
of his owne abilities, or of the worthinesse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
of the receiuers. Especially hee was bountifull
(if that terme may be applyed to immoderate
lauishing)<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> to men of warre: for which cause
many resorted to him from farre Countries for
entertainement. To winne and retaine the
fauour of these, hee much impouerished his
peaceable people. From many he tooke without
iustice, to giue to others without desert: esteeming
it no vnequall dealing, that the money
of the one, should bee aduentured and expended
with the blood of the other.</p>

<p>He much exceeded in sumptuousnes of diet
and of apparell, wherewith great men vse to
dazel the eyes of the people: both which waies
he esteemed the goodnesse of things, by their
price. It is reported, that when his Chamberlaine
vpon a certaine morning brought him a
new paire of hose, the King demaunded what
they cost; and the Chamberlaine answered,
three shillings. Hereat the King grew impatient,
and said: <i>What? heauie beast! doest thou
take these to be conuenient hose for a King? Away
begger, and bring me other of a better price</i>. Then
the Chamberlaine departed and brought a
farre worse paire of hose (for a better could
not at that time bee found) and told the king<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
that they cost a marke. The king not onely allowed
them for fine enough, but commended
them also as exceeding fit. Assuredly this immoderate
excesse of a King is now farre exceeded
by many base shifting vnthrifts.</p>

<p>In building his expences were very great.
He repaired the Citie and Castle of <i>Caerlile</i>,
which had been wasted by the <i>Danes</i> 200. yeres
before. Hee finished New castle vpon <i>Tine</i>.
Many other Castles he erected or repaired vpon
the frontiers of <i>Scotland</i>; many also vpon
the frontiers and within the very brest of <i>Wales</i>.
Hee much enlarged the Towre of <i>London</i>,
and enuironed it with a new wall. Hee also
built the great Hall at <i>Westminster</i>, which is
270. foote in length, and 74. foote in breadth.
And when many did admire the vast largenes
thereof, he would say vnto them, that it was
but a bed chamber, but a closet, in comparison
of that which he intended to build. And accordingly
he layd the foundation of another Hall,
which stretched from the Riuer <i>Thames</i> to the
Kings high street: the further erection wherof,
with diuers other heroicall enterprises, ceased
together with his life.</p>

<p>Thus partly by reason of his infinite plots<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
and inuentions, and partly by his disorders
and vnbrideled liberalities, he alwayes liued at
great charges and expences; which whilest the
large treasure lasted which his father left him,
were borne without grieuance to the subiects:
But when that was once drained, he was reduced
to seeke money by extraordinary meanes.
So, many hard taxes were laid vpon the people,
partly for supplie to his owne necessities, and
partly to imitate the policie of his father; that
the people being busied how to liue, should
reteine small either leisure or meanes to contriue
innouations. For this cause he was supposed,
vpon purpose to haue enterprised many
actions of charge; that thereby he might haue
colour to impose, both imployments and taxations
vpon the people.</p>

<p>And because the riches of the clergie at that
time were not onely an eye-sore vnto many,
but esteemed also by some, to bee very farre aboue
due proportion; Hee often fleeced them
of great summes of money. For which cause it
is euident, that the writers of that age (who
were for the most part Clergie men) did both
generally enueigh against him, and much depraue
his particular actions. He withheld his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
annuall paiment to the Sea of <i>Rome</i>, vpon occasion
of a Schisme betweene <i>Vrbane</i> at <i>Rome</i>,
and <i>Clement</i> at <i>Rauenna</i>. He claimed the inuestiture
of Prelates to be his right: Hee forbade
Appeales and entercourse to <i>Rome</i>: For which
and other like causes he had a very great contention
with the Clergie of his Realme, especially
with <i>Anselme</i> Archbishop of <i>Canterbury</i>.</p>

<p>The seedes of this contention were cast,
when <i>Anselme</i> was first receiued to his Sea. For
at that time two did striue for the Papacie of
<i>Rome</i>; <i>Vrbanus</i> and <i>Guibert</i>, called <i>Clement</i> the
third: some Christian States fauouring the
one, and some the other. King <i>William</i> inclined
to <i>Clement</i> the third, and with him the Realme
generally went; but <i>Anselme</i> did fully goe with
<i>Vrbane</i>; making so his condition before he did
consent to accept his dignitie.</p>

<p>When he was elected and before his consecration,
the King demanded of him, that such
lands of the Church of <i>Canterbury</i> as the King
had giuen to his friends since the death of
<i>Lanfranck</i>, might still be held by them as their
lawfull right: but to this <i>Anselme</i> would in no
case agree. Hereupon the King stayed his consecration
a certaine time; but at length by im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>portunitie
of the people hee was content to receiue
his homage, and to giue way to his consecration.
Not long after, the Archbishop desired
licence of the king to goe to <i>Rome</i>, to receiue
his Pall; which when the King refused to
grant, he appealed to the Sea of <i>Rome</i>. Now
this was the first Appeale that euer before had
been made in <i>England</i>. For Appeales were not
here in ordinarie vse, vntil after this time, vnder
the reigne of King <i>Stephen</i>; when <i>Henrie</i> Bishop
of <i>Wint.</i> being the Popes Legate, brought
them in.</p>

<p>Wherefore the King offended with this noueltie,
charged <i>Anselme</i> with breach of his fealtie
and oath. <i>Anselme</i> answered, that this was
to be referred to the iudgement of a Councell,
whether it bee a breach of allegiance to a terrene
Prince, if a man appeale to the Vicar of
Christ. The King alleaged; that the custome
of his Realme admitted no appeale from the
king; that supreame appeale was a most principall
marke of Maiestie, because no appeale can
be made but to a superiour; that therefore the
Archbishop by appealing from him, denied his
Souereignty, derogated from the dignitie of
his Crowne, and subiected both him and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
to another Prince, to whom as to a superiour
he did appeale; That herein hee was an enemie
and a Traitour to him and to the State.
<i>Anselme</i> replyed, that this question was determined
by our Lord, who taught vs what
allegiance is due to the Pope, where he saith;
<i>Thou art Peter, and vpon this Rocke will I build
my Church, &amp;c.</i> And againe; <i>To thee will I giue
the Keyes of the Kingdome of Heauen, &amp;c.</i> And
againe in generall; <i>Hee that heareth you heareth
me, and who despiseth you despiseth me</i>. And againe,
<i>He that toucheth you, toucheth the apple of
my eye</i>. But for the allegiance due to the King,
he saith; <i>Giue to Cæsar that which belongeth to Cæsar,
and to God what pertaineth to God</i>. To this
the king finally said; That hauing made themselues
Masters to interprete and giue sence to
the Scriptures, it was easie to maintaine by
them whatsoeuer they desired or did; it was
easie for them to burst their ambition with
their swelling greatnes. But well he was assured,
that <span class="f"><span class="smcap">Christ</span></span> intended not to dissolue
orders for Ciuill gouernment, to ruine kingdoms,
to embase authority and right of Kings,
by meanes of his Church: this right of a King
he had, and this right he would maintaine.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span></p>

<p>In this contention few of the Bishops did
openly take part with <i>Anselme</i>; but some, and
especially the Bishop of <i>Durhame</i>, did directly
declare against him. The residue, when he
asked their aduise, would answere him, That
he was wise ynough, and knew what was best
for him to doe; as for them, they neither durst
nor would stand against their Lord. By assistance
of these the King purposed to depriue
<i>Anselme</i>, and to expell him out of the Realme.
But <i>Anselme</i> auowed, That as he was ready to
depart the Realme, so would he take his authoritie
with him, though he tooke nothing else.</p>

<p>Now the King had sent two messengers to
Pope <i>Vrbane</i> at <i>Rome</i>, to entreat him to send
the Pall to the King; to be disposed by him as
he should thinke fit. These messengers were
by this time returned; and with them came
<i>Guibert</i> the Popes Legate, who brought the
Pall. The Legate went first priuily to the King,
and promised that if <i>Vrbane</i> should be receiued
for Pope in <i>England</i>, the King should obtaine
of him whatsoeuer he would. The King
required that <i>Anselme</i> might be remoued. The
Legate answered, that it could not be, that
such a man without iust cause should be remo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>ued;
Notwithstanding some other things being
granted to the King, <i>Vrbane</i> was declared
to be lawfull Pope; and the King was content
to swallow downe that morsel, which had bene
so vnpleasant for him to champe on. The Pall
was caried to <i>Anselme</i> with great pompe, in a
vessell of siluer; and he came foorth bare footed,
in his Priestly Vestments to meete and to
receiue it.</p>

<p>The yeere next following the King inuaded
<i>Wales</i>; where he repressed the rebellious enemies,
and returned victorious. <i>Anselme</i> prepared
to goe vnto him, to salute him, to congratulate
his good successe. But the King preuented
him by messengers, who layde to his
charge, both the small number, and euill appointment
of the Souldiers, which he sent to
that seruice; and therefore warned him to appeare
at the Court, to make his answere. Happely
also the King was incensed by matters
more light; but taken in the worst part, as it
commonly falleth out in suspitions and quarels.
At the day appointed <i>Anselme</i> appeared,
but auoyded his answere by appealing to the
Pope: for prosecution whereof, hee made suit
for the Kings licence to goe to <i>Rome</i>. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
King said as before; That this appeale was against
the custome of the Realme, and against
the dignitie of his Crowne, to both which <i>Anselme</i>
had sworne. <i>Anselme</i> answered, That he
was sworne to neither of them, but so farre as
they were consonant to the Lawes of <span class="smcap">God</span>,
and to the rules of equitie and right. The King
replied, That no limitation being expressed, it
was not reasonable that vpon his owne conceit
of pietie or equitie, he should slip out of
the band of his oath. Thus was the contention
on both sides obstinately maintained; and
for a long time <i>Anselme</i> was commanded to attend
the Court.</p>

<p>At the last hee was released, but vnder expresse
charge, that he should not depart out of
the Realme; or if he did, that it should neuer
be lawfull for him to returne. <i>Anselme</i> departed
from the Court, went streight to <i>Douer</i>,
with purpose to passe the Seas into <i>France</i>.
Here hee was either awaited or ouertaken by
<i>William Warlewast</i> the Kings officer; not to stay
him from his passage, but to rifle him of all that
he had. Others also were appointed to seise
his goods in other places, and to conuert the
profits of his Archbishopricke to the vse of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
King; making a bare allowance to the Monks,
of meat, drinke and cloathing. So the Archbishop
crossed the Seas into <i>France</i>, rested a
while at <i>Lions</i>, and then trauailed ouer the <i>Alpes</i>
to <i>Rome</i>; where he was enterteined by Pope
<i>Vrbane</i>, with more then ordinarie ceremonies
of honour.</p>

<p>And first the Pope wrote to the king of <i>England</i>
on the behalfe of <i>Anselme</i>; and reteined
him in his Palace vntill he should receiue answere
from the king. When the messenger was
returned with such answere as <i>Anselme</i> did not
like, he desired of the Pope to be discharged of
his dignitie; which he had found (he said) a
wearisome stage, whereon hee played a part
much against his will. But hereto the Pope
would in no case agree; charging him vpon
vertue of his obedience, That wheresoeuer he
went, he should beare both the name and honour
of Archbishop of <i>Canterburie</i>. <i>As for
these matters</i>, (said he) <i>we shall sufficiently prouide
for them at the next Councell where your selfe
shalbe present</i>.</p>

<p>When the Councell was assembled, <i>Anselme</i><a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
sate on the outside of the Bishops; but
the Pope called him vp, and placed him at his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
right foot with these words; <i>Includamus hunc in
orbe nostro, tanquam alterius orbis Papam</i>. Afterwards
in all generall Councels, the Archb. of
<i>Canterburie</i> tooke that place. In this Councell
the points of difference betweene the Greeke
and Latine Churches were strongly debated;
especially concerning the proceeding of the
<i>Holy Ghost</i>, and for leauened bread in the administration
of the <i>Eucharist</i>: wherein <i>Anselme</i>
shewed such deepe learning, weight of iudgement,
and edge of wit, that he approched neerer
admiration then applause. These matters
determined, complaints were brought against
the King of <i>England</i>, and the Pope is said
to haue bene ready to excommunicate him:
but <i>Anselme</i> kneeled before the Pope, and obteined
for the King a longer terme. The Pope
was then at great contention with <i>Henry</i> the
fourth Emperour, who had bene excommunicated
before by <i>Hildebrand</i>, and was then againe
excommunicate by <i>Vrbane</i>: being the
first Christian Prince with Souereigne power,
who was euer excommunicate by any Pope.
And for that <i>Vrbane</i> at that time had his hands
full against the Emperour, for that also hee
would not make the example too odious at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
first; he was willing ynough to forbeare excommunication
against the King. And the rather
for that <i>Anselme</i> had intelligence from his
friends in <i>England</i>, that the excommunication
would not be regarded. Hereupon, accompting
it a sufficient declaration of his power for
the time, to haue menaced excommunication,
he caused a generall decree to be made; That
as well all Lay-persons who should giue inuestiture
of Churches, as those of the Clergie who
should be so inuested; also those who should
yeeld themselues in subiection to Lay-men for
Ecclesiastical liuings, should be exc&#333;municate.</p>

<p>This generall sentence was pronounced.
The Pope also signified by letters to the King,
that if he would auoyd particular proceeding
against himselfe, he should foorthwith restore
<i>Anselme</i> to the exercise of his Office in his
Church, and to all the goods and possessions
perteining thereto. Hereupon the King sent
messengers to the Pope, who declared vnto
him; That their great Master the King marueiled
not a litle, wherefore he should so sharply
vrge the restitution of <i>Anselme</i>; seeing it was
expresly told him, That if he departed out of
<i>England</i> without licence, he should expect no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
other vsage. Well, said the Pope, Haue you no
other cause against <i>Anselme</i>, but that he hath
appealed to the Apostolicall Sea, and without
licence of your King hath trauailed thither?
They answered, No. And haue you taken all
this paines (said he) haue you trauailed thus
farre to tell me this? Goe tell your Lord, if he
will not be excommunicate, that he presently
restore <i>Anselme</i> to his Sea: And see that you
bring mee answere hereof the next Councell,
which shalbe in the third weeke after Easter:
make haste, and looke to your terme, lest I cause
you to be hanged for your tarryance.</p>

<p>The messenger was herewith much abashed;
yet collecting himselfe, he desired priuate
audience of the Pope: affirming, that he had
some secret instructions from the King to impart
vnto him. What this secret was it is vnknowne.
Whatsoeuer it was, a longer day was
obtained for the King, vntill Michaelmas then
next ensuing. And when that day was come,
albeit complaints were renued, yet was nothing
done against the King. The Archb. seeing the
small assurance of the Pope, returned to <i>Lions</i>
in <i>France</i>; and there remained vntil the death,
first of Pope <i>Vrbane</i>, and afterwards of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
king; which was almost the space of 3. yeeres.</p>

<p>By this great conflict the king lost the hearts
of many of the Clergie; but his displeasure had
seasoned reuenge with contentment: and finding
himselfe sufficient, both in courage and
meanes to beare out his actions, he became many
other wayes heauie vnto them. When any
Bishopricke or Monasterie fell voyd, he kept
them vacant a long time in his hands, and applied
the profits to himselfe: At the last hee
would set them to open sale, and receiue him
for Prelate, who would giue for them the greatest
price. Herehence two great inconueniences
did ensue; the best places were furnished
with men of least sufficiencie and worth; and
no man hoping to rise by desert, the generall
endeuour for vertue and knowledge were layd
aside: the direct way to aduancement, was by
plaine purchase from the king.</p>

<p>In this seazing and farming and marchandizing
of Church-liuings, one <i>Ranulph</i>, commonly
called the Kings Chapleine, was a great
agent for the King. Hee was a man of faire
vse of speach, and liuely in witte, which hee
made seruants to licentious designes; but both
in birth and behauiour base, and shamelesse in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
dishonestie; a very bawde to all the Kings purposes
and desires. Hee could be so euill as hee
listed, and listed no lesse then was to his aduantage.
The King would often laugh at him, and
say; that he was a notable fellow to compasse
matters for a King. And yet besides more then
ordinary fauour of countenance, the King aduanced
him, first to be his Chancellour, and afterward
to be Bishop of <i>Duresme</i>. By his aduise,
so soone as any Church fell voide, an Inuentory
was made of all the goods that were
found, as if they should bee preserued for the
next successor; and then they were committed
to the custodie of the King, but neuer restored
to the Church againe. So the next incumbent
receiued his Church naked and bare, notwithstanding
that he paid a good price for it. From
this King the vse is said to haue first risen in <i>England</i>,
that the Kings succeeding had the Temporalties
of Bishops Seas so long as they remained
voide. Hee also set the first enformers to
worke, and for small transgressions appointed
great penalties. Hee is also reported to haue
been the first King of this Realme, who restreined
his subiects from ranging into forreine
Countreys without licence.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span></p>

<p>And yet what did the King by this sale of
Church dignities, but that which was most
frequent in other places? For in other places
also few attained to such dignities freely. The
difference was this: here the money was receiued
by the King, there by fauorites or inferiour
officers: here it was expended in the publike
vses of the State; there to priuate and many
times odious enrichments: this seemeth the
more easie, that the more extreme pressure, as
done by more hungrie and degenerous persons:
this may bee esteemed by some the more
base, but assuredly it was the better dealing.
And further, it is euident that the King did
freely aduance many excellent persons to principall
dignities in the Church; and especially
<i>Anselme</i> to the Archbishopricke of <i>Canterburie</i>,
who was so vnwilling to accept that honour,
that the King had much to doe to thrust
it vpon him. And the rather to enduce him, he
gaue him wholly the citie of <i>Canterburie</i>, which
his predecessors had held but at the pleasure of
the King. This <i>Anselme</i> was one whose learned
labours doe plainely testifie, how little his
spirits were fed with the fulsome fumes of surfeting
and ease; which to many others, toge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>ther
with their bodies, doe fatten and engrosse
their mindes. He so detested singularitie,
that he accounted it the sinne which threw
Angels out of Heauen, and man out of Paradise.
This detestation of singularitie might
happily encline him to the other extreme; to
adhere ouer lightly to some common receiued
errours. It is attributed to him that hee would
often wish, to bee rather in hell without sinne,
then with sinne in heauen.</p>

<p>The king also aduanced <i>Robert Bloet</i>, to the
Bishopricke of <i>Lincolne</i>: a man whose wisedom
was highly graced, with goodly personage,
and good deliuery of speach: from whom notwithstanding
the king afterwards wiped fiue
thousand markes. Hee also freely receiued
<i>Hugh de Floriaco</i>, a man for his vertue much
esteemed, to be Abbot of the Monastery of S.
<i>Augustines</i> in <i>Canterburie</i>; and likewise diuers
others to other Ecclesiasticall preferments:
whereby I am confirmed in opinion, that many
odious imputations against the king, were either
altogether inuented, or much enlarged aboue
the trueth.</p>

<p>It happened vpon auoidance of a certaine
Monastery, that two Monkes went to the king,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
either of them contending, as well by friends,
as by large offer of purse, to procure to be made
Abbot of the place. The king espying a third
Monke standing by, who came with the other
two, either to accompany them, or to obtaine
some inferiour place vnder him that should
preuaile, demaunded of him what hee would
giue? The Monke answered, that hee had
small meanes, and lesse minde, to purchase that
or any other dignitie of the Church: For with
that intention did he first betake himselfe to a
religious life, that holding riches and honour
(the two beauties of the world) in contempt,
he might more freely and quietly dispose himselfe
to the seruice of God. The King replied,
that he iudged him most worthy of that preferment;
and therefore first offred it vnto him,
then intreated, and lastly enioyned him to accept
it. Assuredly, the force of vertue is such,
that often times wee honour it in others, euen
when we little esteeme it in ourselues.</p>

<p>He is charged with some actions and speaches
tending to profanenesse. The Iewes at
<i>Roan</i> so preuailed with him by gifts, that they
drew him to reprehend one who had forsaken
their superstition. At <i>London</i> a disputation was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
appointed betweene certaine Christians and
Iewes. The Iewes a little before the day prefixed,
brought to the King a rich present; At
which time he encouraged them (no doubt but
by the way of ioylitie and mirth) to acquite
themselues like tall fellowes, and if they preuailed
by plaine strength of trueth, hee sware (as
was his vsuall) by S. <i>Lukes</i> face, that hee would
become one of their Secte. These things happely
not much spoken amisse, might easily bee
depraued by report.</p>

<p>It is affirmed of him that he so much exceeded
in bodily lust, (then which nothing maketh
a man more contemptible) that thereby
hee seemed to decline from the Maiestie of a
Prince. This vice did cast a great mist ouer his
glorie. And yet neither is it infrequent in lusty
bodies, placed in a State both prosperous
and high, neither can the pleasure of one man
that way extend it selfe to the iniurie of many.
The worst was, that after his example, many
others did follow licentious traces;<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> examples
of Princes being alwayes of greater force then
their Lawes, to induce the people to good or to
euill. As the King turned the prosperitie of his
actions to serue his vanities and delights, so his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
followers by felicitie became insolent, and let
goe at aduenture serious affaires; not receiuing
into their thoughts any other impression then
of brauery and pleasure. And they who were
greatest in the counsailes and fauours of the
King, respected all things no further, then as
they were aduantageable to themselues.</p>

<p>Then rose vp costly apparell, and dainty
fare, two assured tokens of a diseased State; the
one the vainest, the other the grossest prodigalitie
that can be. Then was brought into vse the
laying out of haire, strange fashions and disguisings
in attire, and all delicacies pertaining
to the bodie. Then were practised nice treadings,
lasciuious lookes, and other dissolute and
wanton behauiour: many effeminate persons
did accompanie the Court, by whose immodest
demeanour the maiestie of that place was
much embased. From hence also the poyson
brake foorth, first into the citie, and after
wards into other places of the Realme; for as
in fishes, so in families, and so likewise in
States, putrifaction commonly beginneth at
the head.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span></p>

<p><br />In the second yeere of this kings reigne <i>Lanfranck</i>
Archb. of <i>Canterburie</i> ended his life:
A man highly esteemed, with good men, for his
learning and integritie; with great men, for his
diligence and discretion to sound deepely into
affaires; with the common people for his moderate
and modest behauiour. King <i>William</i> the
first did honour and embrace him with great
respect, and was much guided by his aduise. He
was as a Protector to King <i>William</i> the second.
When he went to <i>Rome</i> to obteine his Pall, the
Pope rose from his chaire, stepped forwards to
meet him, and with many ceremonies of courtesie
did enterteine him. Then he returned to
his seat, and said: <i>Now Lanfrancke, I haue done
to thee what is due to thy vertue, come thou and
doe to me what apperteineth to my place</i>. He was
an earnest enemie to all vices, especially to auarice
and pride, the two banes of all vertues. He
renued the great Church of <i>Canterburie</i>, and
enriched it with 25. mannours. He repaired the
walles of that Citie, and built two Hospitals
therein; one of S. <i>Iohn</i>, the other <i>Harlebaldowne</i>.
He gaue a thousand markes towards the repairing
and enlarging of the Abbey of S. <i>Albones</i>,
and procured <i>Redbourne</i> to be restored there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>to.
By his Testament hee gaue to the same
Church 1000. pounds, besides many rich ornaments.
He tooke great paines in purging ancient
Authors fr&#333; such corruptions as had crept
into them: diuers workes also he wrote of his
owne, but the greatest part of them are perished.
Thus he liued in honour, and died with
fame; his time imployed in honest studies and
exercises, his goods to good and Religious vses.</p>

<p>The same yeere a strange and great earthquake
happened throughout all the Realme;
after which ensued a great scarcitie of fruit, and
a late haruest of corne, so as much graine was
not fully ripe at the end of Nouember.</p>

<p>In the fourth yere of the reigne of this King,
a strong stroke of lightning made a hole in the
Abbey steeple at <i>Winchelscombe</i>, neere to the
top; rent one of the beames of the Church,
brake one of the legges of the Crucifixe, cast
downe the head thereof, together with the Image
of the Virgine <i>Marie</i> that was placed by
it: Herewith a thicke smoke darkened the
Church, and breathed foorth a marueilous
stincke, which annoyed the Church a long
time after. In the same yeere a mightie winde
from the Southwest did prostrate 606. houses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
in <i>London</i>: And breaking into the Church of
S. <i>Mary Bow</i> in Cheape, slew two men with
some part of the ruines which it made, raised
the roofe of the Church, and carried many of
the beames on such a height, that in the fall
six of them, being 27. or 28. foot in length, were
driuen so deepe into the ground (the streets
not then paued with stone) that not aboue 4.
foote remained in sight: and so they stood, in
such order and rancke as the workemen had
placed them vpon the Church. The parts vnder
the earth were neuer raised, but so much
was cut away as did appeare aboue the gro&#363;d;
because it was an impediment for passage. The
Tower of <i>London</i> at the same time was also broken,
and much other harme done.</p>

<p>The next yeere <i>Osmund</i> Bishop of <i>Salisbury</i>
finished the Cathedrall Church of old <i>Salisburie</i>;
and the fifth day after the Consecration, the
steeple thereof was fired with lightning.</p>

<p>The yeere following much raine fell, and so
great frosts ensued, that riuers were passable
with loaden carts.</p>

<p>The yeere next ensuing was exceeding remarkeable
both for the number and fashion of
gliding Starres, which seemed to dash together
in maner of a conflict.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span></p>

<p>About this time Pope <i>Vrbane</i> assembled a
Councell at <i>Cleremont</i> in <i>Auergne</i>, wherein hee
exhorted Christian Princes to ioyne in action
for recouery of <i>Palestine</i>, commonly called <i>The
Holy Land</i>, out of the seruile possession of the
<i>Saracenes</i>. This motion was first set on foote,
and afterwards pursued by <i>Peter</i> the Heremite
of <i>Amiens</i>; which falling in an age both actiue
and Religious, was so generally embraced, as it
drew 300000. men to assemble together from
diuers Countreys; and that with such sober
and harmlesse behauiour, that they seemed rather
Pilgrimes then Souldiers. Among others,
<i>Robert</i> Duke of <i>Normandie</i> addressed himselfe
to this Voyage; and to furnish his expenses
therein, he layed his Duchie of <i>Normandie</i> to
gage to his brother of <i>England</i> for 6666. li. or
as other Authors report, for 13600. pounds of
Siluer.</p>

<p>This money was taken vp part by imposition,
and part by loane, of the most wealthy inhabitants
within the Realme: But especially
the charge was layd vpon religious persons,
for that it was to furnish a religious warre.
When many Bishops and Abbots complained,
that they were not able to satisfie such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
summes of money as the King demanded of
them, vnles they should sel the Chalices &amp; siluer
vessels which pertained to their Churches.
Nay answered the King, you may better make
meanes with the siluer and gold which vainely
you haue wrapped about dead mens bones;
meaning thereby their rich Relickes and
Shrines.</p>

<p>The yeare following a blasing starre appeared,
for the space of fifteene dayes together;
the greatest bush whereof pointed towards
the East, and the lesser towards the West. Gliding
starres were often seene, which seemed to
dart one against another. The people began
(as to mindes fearefull all fancies seeme both
weightie and true) to make hard constructions
of these vnusuall sights; supposing that the
heauens did threaten them, not accustomed
to shew it selfe so disposed, but towards some
variation.</p>

<p>In the 13. yeere of his reigne, the Sea surmounted
his vsuall bounds, in diuers parts of
<i>England</i> and <i>Scotland</i>: whereby not only fields,
but many villages, castles, and townes were ouerflowen,
and some ouerturned, and some ouerwhelmed
with sand; much people, and al<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>most
innumerable cattel was destroyed. At the
same time certaine lands in <i>Kent</i>, which did
once belong to <i>Godwine</i> Earle of <i>Kent</i>, were ouerflowed
and couered with sand, which to
this day do beare the name of <i>Godwins</i> sands.
Thunders were more frequent &amp; terrible then
had been vsuall; through violence whereof diuers
persons were slaine. Many feareful formes
and apparitions are reported to haue bin seene;
whether errours, or inuentions, or truethes, I
will not aduow. The heauens often seemed
to flame with fire. At <i>Finchamsted</i><a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> in <i>Barkeshire</i>
neere vnto <i>Abington</i>, a spring cast vp a
liquor for the space of fifteene dayes, in substance
and colour like vnto blood; which did
taint and infect the next water brooke whereinto
it did runne. The King was often terrified
in his sleepe with vncouth, ougly, vnquiet
dreames: and many fearefull visions of
others were oftentimes reported vnto him.
At the same time hee held in his handes
three Bishoprickes, <i>Canterburie</i>, <i>Winchester</i>,
and <i>Salisburie</i>; and twelue Abbeys.</p>

<p>The same yeere vpon the second of August,
a little before the falling of the Sunne,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
as the King was hunting within the newe
forrest, at a place called <i>Choringham</i> (where
since a Chappell hath beene erected) hee
strooke a Deere lightly with an arrow. The
Deere ranne away, and the King stayed his
horse to looke after it; holding his hand ouer
his eyes, because the beames of the Sunne
(which then drew somewhat lowe) much
dazeled his sight. Herewith another Deere
crossed the way; whereat a certaine Knight,
named Sir <i>Walter Tirrell</i>, aimed with an arrow:
and loosing his bowe, either too carelessly
at the Deere, or too steadily at the
King, strooke him therewith full vpon the
brest. The King hauing so receiued the
wound, gaue foorth a heauie groane, and
presently fell downe dead; neither by speach
nor motion expressing any token of life. Onely
so much of the arrowe as was without his
bodie was found broken; whether with his
hand, or by his fall, it is not certainely knowen.
The men that were neere vnto him (especially
Sir <i>Walter Tirrell</i>) galloped away; some
for astonishment, others for feare. But a
fewe collecting themselues returned againe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
and layd his bodie vpon a Colliers Cart,
which by aduenture passed that way; wherin
it was drawen by one leane euill-fauoured,
base beast, to the Citie of <i>Winchester</i>; bleeding
abundantly all the way, by reason of
the rude iogging of the Carte. The day
following hee was buried, without any funerall
pompe, with no more then ordinarie
solemnities, in the Cathedrall Church or Monasterie
of Saint <i>Swithen</i>; vnder a plaine flat
marble stone, before the Lectorne in the Quire.
But afterwards his bones were translated, and
layd by King <i>Canutus</i> bones.</p>

<p>Most writers doe interprete this extraordinarie
accident to bee a iudgement of God,
for the extraordinarie loose behauiour of the
King, But it may rather seeme a iudgement
of God, that King <i>William</i> the first, who
threw downe Churches, and dispeopled Villages
and Townes; who banished both the
seruice of God, and societie of men, to make
a vaste habitation for sauage beasts, had two
sonnes slaine vpon that place. It may also
seeme a iudgement of God, that King <i>William</i>
the second, who so greatly fauoured beastes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
game, that he ordeined the same penaltie for
killing of a deere, as for killing of a man; should
as a beast, and for a beast, and among beasts be
slaine. And thus God doth often punish vs by
our greatest pleasures; if they be either vnlawfull,
or immoderately affected; whereby good
things become vnlawfull.</p>

<p>Hee died in the principall strength, both of
his age, and of his distastfull actions; wherein
hee had bene much carried by the hoate humour
of his courage and youth; his iudgement
not then raised to that stayednesse and
strength,<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> whereto yeeres and experience in
short time would haue brought it. Hee reigned
in great varietie of opinion with his Subiects
(some applauding his vertues, others
aggrauating his vices) twelue yeeres, eleuen
moneths wanting eight dayes: and was at his
death fourtie and three yeeres old. At this
time he presumed most highly, and promised
greatest matters to himselfe, hee proiected
also many difficult aduentures, if his life had
continued the naturall course; wherein his
hopes were nothing inferiour to his desires.</p>

<p class="center">Hee gaue to the Monckes of <i>Charitie</i> in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
<i>Southwarke</i> his Mannour of <i>Bermondsey</i>, and
built for them the great new Church of Saint
<i>Sauiour</i>.<br /> Also of an old Monasterie in the Citie
of <i>Yorke</i>, he founded an Hospitall<br />
for the sustentation of poore persons and dedicated<br />
it to S. <i>Peter</i>. This Hospitall was afterward<br />

<p>obert Duke of
<i>Normandie</i>, the eldest brother
to King <i>William</i> the second,
was in <i>Palestina</i> when King
<i>William</i> was slaine; being one
of the principal leaders in that Heroical warre,
which diuers Christian Princes of <i>Europe</i> set
vp, to recouer <i>Hierusalem</i> out of the power and
possession of the <i>Saracens</i>. In this expedition
hee purchased so honourable reputation, for
skill, industrie, and valour of hand, that when
the Christian forces had surprised <i>Hierusalem</i>,
and diuers other Cities in those quarters, the
kingdome thereof was offered vnto him. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
the Duke, whether he coniectured the difficulties
of that warre, for that the enemie was
both at hand, and vnder one command, but
the Armie of the Christians was to be supplied
from farre, and also consisted of many Confederats;
In which case albeit sometimes men
performe well at the first, yet in short time inconueniences
encreasing, they alwayes either
dissipate and dissolue, or else fall into confusion.
Or whether he heard of the death of his brother,
to whose Kingdome he pretended right;
as well by prerogatiue of blood, as by expresse
couenant betweene them confirmed by oath;
refused the offer, which was the last period of
all his honour, and in short time after tooke his
iourney from <i>Palestine</i> towards <i>France</i>.</p>

<p>But <i>Henry</i> the Kings yonger brother, apprehending
the opportunitie of the Dukes absence,
did foorthwith seaze vpon the treasure of
the King, and thereby also vpon his State, and
so was crowned at <i>Westminster</i> vpon the second
day of August, in the yeere 1100. by <i>Maurice</i>
Bishop of <i>London</i>; because <i>Anselme</i> Archb. of
<i>Canterburie</i> was then in exile. This enterprise
was much aduanced by the authoritie and industrie
of <i>Henry Newborow</i> Earle of <i>Warwicke</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
who appeased all opposition that was made against
it. The people also, albeit they had bene
managed so tame, as easily to yeeld their backe
to the first sitter; yet to <i>Henry</i> they expressed a
prone inclination, for that hee was borne in
<i>England</i>, at a place called <i>Selby</i> in <i>Lincolneshire</i>,
since his father was crowned King: whereas
Duke <i>Robert</i> his brother was borne before his
father attained the kingdome.</p>

<p>This serued Prince <i>Henry</i> not onely to knit
vnto him the affections of the people, but also
to forme a title to the Crowne. For it hath bin
a question often debated, both by Arguments
and by Armes, and by both trials diuersly decided;
when a king hath two sonnes, one borne
before he was King, and the other after, whether
of them hath right to succeed?</p>

<p><i>Herodotus</i> writeth, That when <i>Darius</i><a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> the
sonne of <i>Hysdaspis</i> King of <i>Persia</i> made preparation
for warre against the <i>Græcians</i> and <i>Egyptians</i>,
he first went about to settle his succession:
because by the Lawes of <i>Persia</i>, the King
might not enter into enterprise of Armes, before
he had declared his successour. Now <i>Darius</i>
had three children before he was King, by
his first wife the daughter of <i>Gobris</i>. After he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
was King he had other foure, by <i>Atossa</i> the
daughter of <i>Cyrus</i>. <i>Artabazanes</i>, or (as other
terme him) <i>Arthemenes</i> was eldest of the first
sort; <i>Xerxes</i> of the second. <i>Artabazanes</i> alleaged
that he was the eldest of all the Kings
sonnes, and that it was a custome among all nations,
That in principalities the eldest should
succeed. <i>Xerxes</i> alleaged, that he was begotten
of <i>Atossa</i> the daughter of <i>Cyrus</i>, by whose
valour the <i>Persians</i> had obteined their Empire.
Before <i>Darius</i> had giuen sentence, <i>Demaratus</i>
the sonne of <i>Aristo</i>, cast out of his kingdome of
<i>Sparta</i> and then liuing an exile in <i>Persia</i>,
came vnto <i>Xerxes</i>, and aduised him further to
alleage, that he was the eldest sonne of <i>Darius</i>
after hee was King; And that it was the custome
of <i>Sparta</i>, that if a man had a sonne in
priuate state, and afterwards another when he
was King, this last sonne should succeed in his
kingdome. Vpon this ground <i>Artabazanes</i>
was reiected, and <i>Darius</i> gaue iudgement for
<i>Xerxes</i>. This history is likewise reported by
<i>Iustine</i>,<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> and touched also by <i>Plutarch</i>: although
they disagree in names, and some other points
of circumstance.</p>

<p>So when <i>Herode</i> King of <i>Iudea</i> appointed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
<i>Antipater</i> his eldest sonne, but borne to him in
priuate state, to succeed in his Royaltie, and excluded
<i>Alexander</i> and <i>Aristobulus</i> his yonger
sonnes, whom he had begot of <i>Mariamne</i>, after
he had obteined his kingdome; <i>Iosephus</i><a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> plainly
reprehendeth the fact, and condemneth the
iudgement of <i>Herode</i> for partiall and vniust. So
<i>Lewes</i> borne after his father was Duke of <i>Milane</i>,<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
was preferred in succession before his brother
<i>Galeace</i>, who was borne before. And so
when <i>Otho</i> the first was elected Emperour, his
yonger brother <i>Henry</i> pretended against him;
for that <i>Otho</i><a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> was borne before their father was
Emperour, and <i>Henry</i> after. In which quarrell
<i>Henry</i> was aided by <i>Euerharde</i> Earle Palatine,
and <i>Giselbert</i> Duke of <i>Lorreine</i>, with diuers other
Princes of <i>Almaine</i>: But when the cause
came to be canuased by the sword, the victorie
adiudged the Empire to <i>Otho</i>.</p>

<p>Furthermore, this right of title seemeth to
be confirmed by many grounds of the Imperial
Law. As<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> that sonnes borne after their father
is aduanced to a dignitie, doe hold certaine priuiledges,
which sonnes formerly borne doe not

Which must be vnderstood with this distinction,
if the kingdome be either newly erected, or
else newly acquired by Conquest, Election, or
any such title, other then by hereditarie succession
according to proximitie in blood. For if
the kingdome bee once seded in a certaine
course of succession, because the dignitie is inherent
in the blood of that stocke; because it is
not taken from the father but from the ancestors;
because it is not taken onely from the ancestors,
but from the fundamentall law of the
State; the eldest sonne shall indistinctly succeede,
although hee were borne before his father
was King<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>. And therefore after the kingdome
of <i>Persia</i> had been caried by succession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
in some descents, when <i>Darius</i> the King had
foure sonnes, <i>Artaxerxes</i> the eldest, <i>Cyrus</i> the
next, and two others; <i>Parysates</i> the wife of <i>Darius</i>
hauing a desire that <i>Cyrus</i> should succeede
in the kingdome, alleaged in his behalfe the
same reason wherewith <i>Xerxes</i> had preuailed
before: to wit, that shee had brought foorth
<i>Artaxerxes</i> to <i>Darius</i>, when hee was in priuate
state; but <i>Cyrus</i> was borne to him when he was
a King. Yet <i>Plutarch</i><a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> affirmeth, that the reason
which she vsed was nothing probable, and that
<i>Artaxerxes</i> the eldest sonne was appointed to
be King. And so <i>Blondus</i><a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> and <i>Ritius</i> doe report,
that <i>Bela</i> the King of <i>Hungarie</i> being
dead, <i>Geysa</i> succeeded, although borne vnto
him before he was a King.</p>

<p>Others inferiour in number, but not in
weight of Iudgement do affirme, that whether
a Kingdome be setled in succession, or whether
by any other title newly attained, the right to
succeed by all true grounds of law pertaineth to
the eldest sonne; albeit borne before his fathers
aduancement to the kingdome, in case
there be no expresse law of the state to the contrary.
The principall reason is, because this is
the nature of all successions by way of inheri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>tance:
For, if a father purchaseth lands, leases,
cattell, or other goods, the inheritance shall
bee transmitted to his eldest sonne, although
borne before the purchase. Likewise if a father
be aduanced to any title of honour, as Duke,
Earle, Marquesse, &amp;c. it was neuer, I will not
say denied, but once doubted, but that the eldest
sonne should succeede in the same, albeit
he was borne before the aduancement. And
therefore seeing this is the generall rule of all other
inheritable successions, and there is no reason
of singularitie in a kingdome; it followeth,
that in like case the succession of a kingdome
should also descend to the eldest sonne, although
borne before the kingdome were atchieued.</p>

<p>Againe, the sonne who was borne before
his father was a King, had once a right to succeede
in the kingdome; for if another sonne
had not afterwards beene borne, without all
question hee should haue succeeded. But a
right which a man by his owne person hath acquired;
albeit in some cases it may be diminished,
yet can it not bee altogether extinguished
by any externall or casuall euent, which
hath no dependencie vpon himselfe. And so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
the right which the eldest sonne hath to his fathers
inheritance, may bee diminished by the
birth of other children, in regard of those
goods which are to bee distributed in parts among
them; but it cannot possibly be extinguished.
Neither can it bee diminished in those
things which are not of nature to bee either
valued or diuided (of which sort a Kingdome
is the chiefe) but doe passe entirely vnto
one. For the right of blood which onely is regarded
in lawfull successions, is acquired and
held from the natiuitie of the childe, and doth
not begin at the fathers death; at which time
the inheritance doth fall.</p>

<p>Lastly, if it be true in sonnes, that he shal succeede
in a kingdome who is first borne, after
the father is exalted to bee a King; then is it
true also in other remote degrees of consanguinitie.
And hereby it should often happen, that
when a King dieth without issue of his body,
they who are not onely inferiour in age, but
more remote in degree, should exclude both
the elder and the neerer in blood; because perhaps
borne after the kingdome was attained:
which is against all lawes of lawfull succession.</p>

<p>Howsoeuer the right standeth, <i>Henry</i> the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
yonger brother to King <i>William Rufus</i>, vpon
aduantage of the absence of Duke <i>Robert</i> his
eldest brother, formed this title to the Crowne
of <i>England</i>. In which pretence he was strongly
supported, first by a generall inclination of the
common people, for that he had both his birth
and education within the Realme, and they
were well perswaded of his good nature and
disposition. Secondly, by the fauour and trauaile
of many of the nobilitie, especially of <i>Henry
Neuborow</i> Earle of <i>Warwicke</i>. Thirdly, (for
that the sailes of popular fauours are filled most
violently with reports) by his giuing forth, that
his brother <i>Robert</i> intended neuer to returne;
for that he was elected King of <i>Hierusalem</i>, and
of all those large Countreys in <i>Asia</i>, which the
Christians had lately wrung out of the <i>Saracens</i>
hands. Lastly, by vsing celeritie the very
life of actions; for he was Crowned at <i>Westminster</i>
(as it hath bene said) vpon the fifth day
of August, in the yeere 1100. which was the
third day after his brothers death.</p>

<p>In person he was both stately and strong;
tall, broad brested, his limmes fairely fourmed,
well knit, and fully furnished with flesh. He was
exceeding both comely and manly in counte<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>nance,
his face wel fashioned, his colour cleere,
his eyes liuely and faire, his eye-browes large
and thicke, his haire blacke and somewhat
thinne towards his forehead. He was of an excellent
wit, free from ostentation; his thoughts
high, yet honourable and iust: in speach ready
and eloquent, much graced with sweetnesse of
voyce. In priuate he was affable, open, wittily
pleasant, and very full of merrie simplicitie: in
publicke he looked with a graue Maiestie, as
finding in himselfe cause to be honoured. He
was brought vp in the studie of Liberall Arts at
<i>Cambridge</i>, where he attained that measure of
knowledge, which was sufficient both for ornament
and vse; but ranne not into intemperate
excesse, either for ostentation, or for a
cloake to vnprofitable expense of time. By his
example the yong Nobilitie of the Realme began
to affect a praise for learning: Insomuch
as, at a certaine enteruiew betweene the King
and Pope <i>Innocent</i> the 2. the sonnes of <i>Robert</i>
Earle of <i>Mellent</i>, maintained open disputations
against diuers Cardinals and Chapleines of
the Pope.</p>

<p>He was an exact esteemer of himselfe, not so
much for his strength as for his weakenesses:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
lesse inclined to confidence then to distrust; and
yet in weighty affaires resolute and firme; neuer
dismaied, and alwayes fortunate; his spirits being
of force to oppose against any sort of difficulties
or doubts. Extremities made him the
more assured; and like a well knit Arch, hee
then lay most strong when hee sustained the
greatest weight. Hee was no more disposed to
valour, then well setled in vertue and goodnes;
which made his valour of more precious valuation.
He had good command ouer his passions;
and thereby attained both peace within himselfe,
and victory ouer others. In giuing hee
was moderate, but bountifull in recompence;
his countenance enlarging the worth of his
gift. Hee was prone to relieue, euen where
there was least likelihood of requitall. He hated
flatterie, the poysoned sugar, the counterfeit
ciuilitie and loue, the most base brokery of
wordes: yet was no musicke so pleasing vnto
him as well deserued thankes. He was vigilant
and industrious in his affaires; knowing right
well that honour not onely hath a paineful and
dangerous birth, but must in like manner be
nourished and fed.</p>

<p>He was somewhat immoderate and exces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>siue,
as well in aduancing those he fauoured, as
in beating downe and disabling his enemies.
The sword was alwayes the last of his trials; so
as he neuer either sought or apprehended occasions
of warre, where with honour he could
reteine peace. But if it were iniuriously vrged,
he wanted neither wisedome, nor diligence, nor
magnanimous heart to encounter the danger;
to beare it ouer with courage and successe. He
was frugall of the blood and slaughter of his
Souldiers; neuer aduenturing both his honour
&amp; their liues to the hazard of the sword, without
either necessitie or aduantage. He oftentimes
preuailed against his enemies more by
policie then by power; and for victories thus
attained, he attributed to himselfe the greatest
glory. For wisedome is most proper to man,
but force is common and most eminent in
beasts; by wisedome the honour was entire to
himselfe, by force it was participated to inferiour
Commanders, to euery priuate ordinarie
Souldier: the effects of force, are heauie, hideous,
and sometimes inhumane; but the same
wrought to euent by wisedome, is, as lesse odious,
so more assured and firme.</p>

<p>After that he was mounted into the seate of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
Maiestie, hee neglected no meanes to settle
himselfe most surely therin, against the returne
of his brother <i>Robert</i>. To this end he contracted
both amitie and alliance with <i>Edgar</i> King
of <i>Scots</i>, by taking his sister <i>Matild</i> to wife: by
which meanes he not onely remoued his hostilitie,
but stood assured of his assistance, in case
his occasions should so require. Shee was
daughter to <i>Malcolme</i> King of <i>Scots</i>, by <i>Margaret</i>
his wife; who was sister to <i>Edgar</i> surnamed
<i>Adeling</i>, and daughter to <i>Edward</i>, sonne to <i>Edmund
Ironside</i>, the most valiant Saxon King, the
scourge and terrour of the <i>Danes</i>. So as after
the death of <i>Adeling</i> who left no issue, this <i>Matild</i>
was next by discent from the Saxon Kings
to the inheritance of the Crowne of <i>England</i>:
and by her entermariage with King <i>Henry</i>, the
two families of <i>Normans</i> and <i>Saxons</i> were vnited
together both in blood and title to the
Crowne. This more then any other respect
made the whole nation of the <i>English</i> not onely
firme to King <i>Henrie</i>, against his brother, but
loyall and peaceable during all his reigne: for
that they saw the blood of their <i>Saxon</i> Kings
restored again to the possession of the Crowne.</p>

<p>Shee was a Lady vertuous, religious, beauti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>full
and wise: farre from the ordinary either
vices or weakenesses incident to her sexe. She
had been brought vp among the Nunnes of
<i>Winchester</i>, and <i>Rumsey</i>, whether professed or
onely veiled our writers doe diuersly report;
but most affirme that shee was professed. Yet
for the common good, for the publique peace
and tranquilitie of the State, shee abandoned
her deuoted life, and was ioyned to King <i>Henrie</i>
in mariage, by consent of <i>Anselme</i>, without
any dispensation from <i>Rome</i>. Of this <i>Matild</i>
the King begate <i>William</i> a sonne, who perished
by shipwracke; and <i>Matild</i> a daughter, first
married to <i>Henry</i> the fifth Emperour, by whom
she had no issue; afterward to <i>Geoffrey Plantagenet</i>
Earle of <i>Aniou</i>, by whom shee brought
foorth a sonne named <i>Henrie</i>, in whom the
blood of the Saxon Kings was aduanced againe
to the gouernment of this Realme.</p>

<p>Now to purchase the fauour of the Clergie,
he called <i>Anselme</i> out of exile, and restored him
both to the dignitie and reuenues of the Sea of
<i>Canterbury</i>. Other Bishoprickes and Abbeys
which King <i>William</i> kept voide at the time of
his death, hee furnished with men of best
sufficiencie and reputation. Hee committed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
<i>Radulph</i> Bishop of <i>Durham</i> to prison, who had
been both authour and agent to King <i>William</i>
in most of his distastfull actions against the
Clergie. This <i>Radulph</i> was a man of smooth
vse of speach, wittie onely in deuising, or speaking,
or doing euill: but to honestie and vertue
his heart was a lumpe of lead. Enuious aboue
all measure; nothing was so grieuous to his
eyes as the prosperitie, nothing so harsh to his
eares as the commendations of others. His
tongue alwayes slauish to the Princes desires;
not regarding how truely or faithfully, but
how pleasingly he did aduise. Thus as a principall
infamie of that age, hee liued without
loue, and died without pitie; sauing of those
who thought it pitie that he liued so long.</p>

<p>Further, to make the Clergie the more assured,
the King renounced the right which his
Ancesters vsed in giuing Inuestitures; and acknowledged
the same to appertaine to the
Pope. This hee yeelded at his first entrance,
partly not knowing of what importance it was,
and partly being in necessitie to promise any
thing. But afterwards he resumed that right
againe; albeit in a Councell not long before
held at <i>Rome</i>, the contrary had bene decreed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
For hee inuested <i>William Gifford</i> into the Bishopricke
of <i>Winchester</i>, and all the possessions
belonging to the same. He gaue the Archbishopricke
of <i>Canterburie</i> to <i>Radulph</i> Bishop of
<i>London</i>, and inuested him therein by a Ring
and a staffe: he inuested also two of his Chapleins
at <i>Westminster</i>; <i>Roger</i> his Chanceller in
the Bishopricke of <i>Salisburie</i>, and <i>Roger</i> his
Larderer in the Bishopricke of <i>Hereford</i>. Further
he assumed the custome of his father and
brother, in taking the reuenues of Bishopricks
whilest they remained void: and for that cause
did many times keepe them a longer season vacant
in his hands, then many of the Clergie
could with patience endure.</p>

<p>But especially the Clergie did fauour him
much, by reason of his liberall leaue either to
erect, or to enlarge, or else to enrich Religious
buildings. For to these workes the King was
so ready to giue, not onely way, but encouragement
and helpe, that in no Princes time they
did more within this Realme either flourish or
increase. And namely the house of S. <i>Iohn</i> of
<i>Hierusalem</i> was then founded neere <i>Smithfield</i>
in London, with the house of Nunnes by <i>Clerken-well</i>.
Then were also founded the Church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
of <i>Theukesburie</i>, with all Offices thereto belonging:
the Priorie and Hospitall of S. <i>Bartholomewes</i>
in <i>Smithfield</i>, the Church of S. <i>Giles</i> without
<i>Creeplegate</i>; the Colledge of Seculare Canons
in the castle of <i>Leicester</i>; the Abbey without
the Northgate of the same towne called S.
<i>Mary de prato</i>. Also the Monasterie of S. <i>Iohn</i> of
<i>Lanthonie</i> by <i>Glocester</i>; the Church of <i>Dunmow</i>
in <i>Essex</i>; the Monasterie of S. <i>Iohn</i> at <i>Colchester</i>,
which was the first house of <i>Augustine</i> Chanons
in <i>England</i>: the Church of S. <i>Mary Oueries</i> furnished
with Chanons in <i>Southwarke</i>; the Priory
of the holy Trinity now called <i>Christs Church</i>
within <i>Algate</i>; and the Hospitall of S. <i>Giles</i> in
the field: The Priorie of <i>Kenelworth</i>; The Abbey
of <i>Kenshame</i>; The Monasterie of <i>Plimpton</i>
in <i>Deuonshire</i>; with the Cathedrall Church of
<i>Exceter</i>; the Priorie of <i>Merton</i>; the Colledge of
<i>Warwicke</i>; the Hospitall of <i>Kepar</i>; the Priorie
of <i>Osney</i> neere <i>Oxeford</i>; the Hospital of S. <i>Crosse</i>
neere <i>Winchester</i>; the Priorie of <i>Norton</i> in <i>Cheshire</i>,
with diuers others. The King also founded
and erected the Priorie of <i>Dunstable</i>, the
Abbey of <i>Circester</i>, the Abbey of <i>Reading</i>, the
Abbey of <i>Shirebourne</i>. Hee also changed the
Abbey of <i>Eley</i> into a Bishops Sea; he erected a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
Bishopricke at <i>Caerlile</i>, placed Chanons there,
and endowed it with many honours. These
and many other Religious buildings either
done, or helped forward, or permitted and allowed
by the King, much encreased the affection
of the Clergie towards him.</p>

<p>Now to draw the loue of the common people,
he composed himselfe to a sober ciuilitie;
easie for accesse, faire in speach, in countenance
and behauiour kind: his Maiestie so tempered
with mildnesse and courtesie, that his Subiects
did more see the fruits, then feele the weight of
his high estate. These were things of great moment
with the vulgar sort; who loue more
where they are louingly intreated, then where
they are benefited, or happely preserued. He
eased them of many publicke grieuances. Hee
restored them to the vse of fire and candle after
eight of the clocke at night, which his father
had most straitly forbidden. Punishments of
losse of member vsed before, he made pecuniarie.
Hee moderated the Law of his brother,
which inflicted death for killing any of the
Kings Deere; and ordeined, that if any man
killed a Deere in his owne wood, the wood
should be forfeited to the King. He permitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
to make enclosures for Parkes; which taking
beginning in his time, did rise to that excessiue
encrease, that in a few succeeding ages more
Parkes were in <i>England</i>, then in all <i>Europe</i> beside.
He promised that the Lawes of K. <i>Edward</i>
should againe be restored; but to put off the
present performance, he gaue forth, that first
they should be reuiewed and corrected, and
made appliable to the present time. And albeit
in trueth they were neuer either reuiewed or
corrected, yet the onely hope thereof did
worke in the people a fauourable inclination to
his part.</p>

<p>Whilest the King did thus Immure himselfe
in the state of <i>England</i>, as well by ordering
his affaires, as by winning the hearts of the
people vnto him, Duke <i>Robert</i> was returning
from <i>Palestine</i>, by easie and pleasurable iourneys;
vsing neither the celeritie nor forecast
which the necessitie of his occasions did require.
Hee visited many Princes by the way,
and consumed much time in entertainments
and other complements of Court. Hee tooke
to wife as he came <i>Sibell</i> the daughter of <i>Roger</i>
Duke of <i>Apulia</i> and Earle of <i>Cicill</i>, who was a
<i>Norman</i>: and the great portion of money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
which he receiued for her dower, he loosely lauished
foorth amongst his followers; of whom
he receiued nothing againe, but thankes when
he (scattered rather then) gaue, and pitie when
he wanted.</p>

<p>At the last he arriued in <i>Normandie</i>, and
foorthwith was sollicited out of <i>England</i> by letters
from many, who either vpon conscience or
discontentment fauoured his Title; and especially
from <i>Radulph</i> Bishop of <i>Durham</i>, who
had lately escaped out of prison, a man odious
ynough to vndoe a good cause; that he would
omit no time, that hee would let fall no diligence,
to embarke himselfe in the enterprise for
<i>England</i>: that he had many friends there, both
powerfull and sure, who would partake with
him in his dangers, although not in the honour
atchieued by his dangers: that therewith
the peoples fauour towards the King did begin
to ebbe, and that it was good taking the
first of the tide. Hereupon he shuffled vp an
Armie in haste; neither for number, nor furniture,
nor choise of men answerable to the enterprise
in hand. Then he crossed the Seas, landed
at <i>Portesmouth</i>, and marched a small way
into the Countrey; vainely expecting the con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>course
and ayd which had bene assured him
out of <i>England</i>. But King <i>Henry</i> had made so
good vse both of his warning and time to prouide
against this tempest, that hee did at once
both cut from the Duke all meanes of ayd, and
was ready to encounter him in braue appointment.
Hereupon many who were vnable by
Armes to relieue the Duke, by aduise did to
him the best offices they could. For they laboured
both the King and him to a reconcilement;
The King with respect of his new vnsettled
estate, the Duke with respect of his weakenesses
and wants; both with regard of naturall
duetie and loue, knit betweene them by band
of blood. So after some trauaile and debatement,
a peace was concluded vpon these Conditions.</p>

<p><i>That <span class="f">Henry</span> should reteine the kingdome of
<span class="f">England</span>, and pay to his brother <span class="f">Robert</span> 3000.
markes yeerely.</i></p>

<p><i>That if either of them should die without issue,
the suruiuour should succeed.</i></p>

<p><i>That no man should receiue preiudice for following
the part of the one or of the other.</i></p>

<p>These conditions being solemnely sworne
by the king and the Duke, and twelue Noble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
men on either part, the Duke returned into
<i>Normandie</i>, and about two yeeres after went
againe into <i>England</i>, to visit the King, and to
spend some time with him in feasting and disport.
At which time, to requite the Kings kind
vsage and entertainment, but especially to gratifie
<i>Matild</i> the Queene, to whom he was godfather,
he released to the King the annuall payment
of 3000. markes. But as a wound is more
painefull the day following, then when it was
first and freshly taken; so this loose leuitie of
the Duke, which was an exceeding sad and
sore blow to his estate, was scarce sensible at his
departure out of <i>England</i>, but most grieuous to
him after hee had remained in <i>Normandie</i> a
while: whereby many motions were occasioned,
as well in the one place as in the other.</p>

<p>The Duke complained, that hee had bene
circumuented by his brother the King: that his
courtesies were nothing else but allurements
to mischiefe; that his gifts were pleasant
baites, to couer and conuey most dangerous
hookes; that his faire speaches were sugred
poysons; that his kinde embracements were
euen to tickle his friends to death. <i>Robert Belasme</i>
Earle of <i>Shrewsbury</i>, a man of great estate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
but doubtfull whether of lesse wisedome or
feare, tooke part with the Duke, and fortified
the Towne and Castle of <i>Shrewsbury</i>, the Castles
of <i>Bridgenorth</i>, <i>Tichel</i>, and <i>Arundel</i>, and
certaine other pieces in <i>Wales</i> against King
<i>Henry</i>. And hauing drawen vnto him some
persons of wretched state and worse minde,
whose fortunes could not bee empaired by any
euent, hee entred <i>Stafford shire</i>, and droue
away light booties of cattell; being prepared
neither in forces nor in courage, to stay the doing
of greater mischiefe.</p>

<p>But neither was this sudden to the King,
neither was he euer vnprouided against sudden
aduentures. Wherefore encountring the danger
before it grew to perfection and strength,
he first brought his power against the Castle of
<i>Bridgenorth</i>, which was forthwith rendred vnto
him. The residue followed the example
(which in enterprise of armes is of greatest moment)
and submitted themselues to the Kings
discretion. Onely the Castle of <i>Arundel</i> yeelded
vpon condition, that <i>Robert Belasme</i> their
Lord should be permitted to depart safely into
<i>Normandie</i>: And vpon the same condition
they of <i>Shrewsbury</i> sent to the King the keys of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
their Castle, and therewith pledges for their allegeance.
Then <i>Robert</i> with his brother <i>Ernulphus</i>,
and <i>Roger</i> of <i>Poictiers</i> abiured the
Realme, and departed into <i>Normandie</i>: where
being full of rashnesse, which is nothing but
courage out of his wits; and measuring their
actions not by their abilities, but by their desires;
they did more aduance the Kings affaires
by hostilitie, then by seruice and subiection
they could possibly haue done.</p>

<p>Also <i>William</i> Earle of <i>Mortaigne</i> in <i>Normandie</i>,
and of <i>Cornewall</i> in <i>England</i>, sonne of <i>Robert</i>,
vncle to the king, and brother to king <i>William</i>
the first, required of the King the Earledome
of <i>Kent</i>, which had been lately held by
<i>Odo</i> vncle to them both. And being a man
braue in his owne liking, and esteming nothing
of that which hee had in regard of that
which hee did desire, he was most earnest, violent,
peremptorie in his pursuit. Insomuch as,
blinded with ambitious haste, he would often
say, that hee would not put off his vpper garment,
vntill hee had obtained that dignitie of
the King. These errours were excused by the
greenenesse of his youth, and by his desire of
rising, which expelled all feare of a fall. Where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>fore
the King first deferred, and afterwards
moderately denied his demaund. But so farre
had the Earle fed his follies with assured expectation,
that he accompted himselfe fallen from
such estate as his hungry hopes had already
swallowed. Hereupon his desire turned to
rage, and the one no lesse vaine then the other:
but both together casting him from a high degree
of fauour, which seldome stoppeth the
race vntill it come to a headlong downefall.</p>

<p>For now the King made a counter-challenge
to many of his possessions in <i>England</i>; and
thereupon seazed his lands, dismantled his castles,
and compelled him in the end to forsake
the Realme. Not for any great offence he had
done, being apt to the fault rather of rough
rage then of practise and deceit; but his stubborne
stoutnesse was his offence; and it was sufficient
to hold him guiltie, that he thought
himselfe to haue cause and meanes to be guiltie.
So hauing lost his owne state in <i>England</i>, he
departed into <i>Normandie</i>, to further also the
losse of that countrey. There he confederated
with <i>Robert Belasme</i>, and made diuers vaine
attempts against the Kings castles; neither guided
by wisedome, nor followed by successe.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
Especially hee vented his furie against <i>Richard</i>
Earle of <i>Chester</i>, who was but a childe, and in
wardship to the King, whom he daily infested
with inuasions and spoiles; being no lesse full
of desire to hurt, then voyd of counsaile and
meanes to hurt.</p>

<p>On the other side, diuers of the Nobilitie of
<i>Normandie</i>, finding their Duke without iudgement
to rule, had no disposition to obey; but
conceiued a carelesse contempt against him.
For he seemed not so much to regard his substantiall
good, as a vaine breath of praise, and
the fruitlesse fauour of mens opinions, which
are no fewer in varietie then they are in number.
All the reuenues of his Duchie he either
sold or morgaged; all his Cities he did alien,
and was vpon the point of passing away his
principall Citie of <i>Roan</i> to the Burgers thereof,
but that the conditions were esteemed too
hard. Hereupon many resolued to fall from
him, and to set their sailes with the fauourable
gale which blew vpon the fortune of the King.
To this end they offered their submission to
the King, in case he would inuade <i>Normandie</i>;
whereto with many reasons they did perswade
him: especially in regard of the late hostile at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>tempts
there made against him, by the plaine
permission of the Duke his brother, and not
without his secret support.</p>

<p>The King embraced the faire occasion, and
with a strong Armie passed into <i>Normandie</i>.
Here he first relieued his forts, which were any
wayes distressed or annoyed; then he recouered
those that were lost; Lastly, he wanne from
the Duke the towne and castle of <i>Caen</i>, with
certaine other castles besides: And by the help
of the President of <i>Aniou</i>, fired <i>Baion</i>, with the
stately Church of S. <i>Marie</i> therein. Vpon these
euents, all the Priories of <i>Normandie</i>, resembling
certaine flowers, which open and close
according to the rising or declining of the
Sunne; abandoned the Duke, and made their
submission to King <i>Henry</i>. So the King hauing
both enlarged and assured his state in <i>Normandie</i>,
by reason of the approch of winter, departed
into <i>England</i>: but this was like the recuiling
of Rammes, to returne againe with the
greater strength.</p>

<p>He had not long remained in <i>England</i>, but
his brother <i>Robert</i> came to him at <i>Northampton</i>,
to treat of some agreement of peace. Here
the words and behauiours of both were obser<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>ued.
At their first meeting they rested with
their eyes fast fixed one vpon the other; in such
sort as did plainely declare, that discourtesie
then trencheth most deep, when it is betweene
those who should most dearely loue. The
Duke was in demaunds moderate, in countenance
and speech enclined to submisnesse; and
with a kinde vnkindnesse did rather entreate
then perswade, that in regard of the naturall
Obligation betweene them by blood, in regard
of many offices and benefits wherewith he had
endeuoured to purchase the Kings loue, all hostilitie
betweene them, all iniurie or extremitie
by Armes might cease. <i>For I call you</i> (said he)
<i>before the Seate of your owne Iudgement, whether
the relinquishing of my Title to the Crowne of <span class="f">England</span>,
whether the releasing of my annuity of <span class="f">3000.</span>
markes, whether many other kindnesses, so much
vndeserued as scarce desired; should not in reason
withdraw you from those prosecutions, where warre
cannot be made without shame, nor victory attained
without dishonour</i>.</p>

<p>The King vsed him with honourable respect;
but perceiuing that he was embarked in
some disaduantage, conceiuing also that his
courage with his Fortune began to decline, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
made resemblance at the first, to be no lesse desirous
of peace then the Duke: But afterwards,
albeit he did not directly deny, yet hee found
euasions to auoyd all offers of agreement.</p>

<p>The more desirous the Duke was of peace,
the greater was his disdaine that his brother
did refuse it. Wherefore cleering his countenance
from all shewes of deiection or griefe, as
then chiefly resolute when his passion was stirred,
with a voice rather violent then quicke, he
rose into these words.</p>

<p><i>I haue cast my selfe so low, as your haughty heart
can possibly wish; whereby I haue wronged both my
selfe and you: my selfe, in occasioning some suspition
of weakenesse; you, in making you obstinate in your
ambitious purposes. But assure your selfe, that this
desire did not proceed from want either of courage,
or of meanes, or of assistance of friends: I can also
be both vnthankefull and vnnaturall if I bee compelled.
And if all other supportance faile, yet no
arme is to be esteemed weake, which striketh with
the sword of necessitie and Iustice.</i></p>

<p>The King with a well appeased stayednesse
returned answere; that he could easily endure
the iniurie of his angry wordes: but to men of
moderate iudgement hee would make it ap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>peare,
that hee entended no more in offending
him, then to prouide for defending himselfe. So
the Duke obseruing few complements, but
such as were spiced with anger and disdaine,
returned into <i>Normandie</i>, associated to him
the <i>English</i> exiles, and made preparation for
his defence.</p>

<p>The King followed with a great power, and
found him in good appointment of armes: nothing
inferiour to the King in resolute courage,
but farre inferiour both in number of men, and
in fine contriuance of his affaires. For the King
had purchased assured intelligence, among
those that were neerest both in place and counsaile
to the Duke: in whom the Duke found
treacherie, euen when he reposed most confident
trust. Herewith Pope <i>Paschal</i>, to attaine
his purpose in <i>England</i>, for deuesting the King
of inuesting Bishops; did not onely allow this
enterprise for lawful, but encouraged the King,
that hee should doe thereby a noble and a memorable
benefit to his Realme.</p>

<p>So, many stiffe battels were executed betweene
them, with small difference of aduantage
at the first; but after some continuance, the
Dukes side (as it commonly happeneth to euill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
managed courage) declined dayly, by reason
of his dayly increase of wants. At the last the
Duke, wearied and ouerlayed, both with company
of men and cunning working, resolued
to bring his whole state to the stake, and to aduenture
the same vpon one cast: committing to
Fortune, what valour and industry could bring
forth. The king being the Inuader, thought it
not his part to shrinke from the shocke; being
also aduertised that the <i>French</i> King prepared
to relieue the Duke. On the Dukes side, disdaine,
rage, and reuenge, attended vpon hate:
the King retained inuincible valour, assured
hope to ouercome, grounded vpon experience
how to ouercome.</p>

<p>They met vpon the same day of the moneth
iust 40. yeeres, after the great battaile of
<i>William</i> the first against King <i>Harold</i> of <i>England</i>.
The Kings footemen farre exceeding
their enemies in number, began the charge, in
small and scattering troupes; lightly assayling
where they could espie the weakest resistance.
But the Dukes Armie receiued them in close
and firme order; so as vpon the losse of many
of the foremost, the residue began somewhat
to retire. And now, whether the Duke had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
cause, or whether confidence the inseparable
companion of courage perswaded him that he
had cause; he supposed that hee had the best of
the field, and that the victory was euen in his
hand. But suddenly the King with his whole
forces of horse charged him in flanke, and with
great violence brake into his battaile. Herewith
the footmen also returned, and turned
them all to a ruinous rout. The Duke performed
admirable effects of valour, and so did
most of the <i>English</i> exiles: as fearing ouerthrow
worse then death. But no courage was sufficient
to sustaine the disorder; the <i>Normans</i> on
euery hand were chased, ruffled, and beaten
downe. Hereupon the Dukes courage boyling
in choller, hee doubled many blowes vpon his
enemies; more furiously driuen, then well placed
and set: and pressing vp hardly among
them, was suddenly engaged so farre, that hee
could not possibly recouer himselfe. So he was
taken manfully fighting, or as some other authours
affirme, was beastly betrayed by his
owne followers. With him were also taken
the Earle of <i>Mortaigne</i>, <i>William Crispine</i>, <i>William
Ferreis</i>, <i>Robert Estotiuill</i>, with foure hundred
men of armes, and ten thousand ordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
souldiers. The number of the slaine on both
sides, is not reported by any authour; but all
authours agree, that this was the most bloody
medly that euer had been executed in <i>Normandie</i>
before: portended as it is thought by a
Comet, and by two full Moones, which late
before were seene, the one in the East, and the
other in the West.</p>

<p>After this victorie the King reduced <i>Normandie</i>
entirely into his possession, and annexed
it to the Realme of <i>England</i>. Then hee
built therein many Castles, and planted garrisons;
and with no lesse wisedome assured that
State, then with valour he had wonne it. When
he had setled all things according to his iudgement,
he returned into <i>England</i>, brought with
him his brother <i>Robert</i>, and committed him to
safe custodie in the Castle of <i>Cardiff</i>. But either
by reason of his fauourable restraint, or else by
negligence or corruption of his keepers, he escaped
away, and fled for his libertie as if it had
been for his life. Notwithstanding this proued
but a false fauour, or rather a true flatterie or
scorne of Fortune. For being sharply pursued,
he was taken againe, sitting vpon horsebacke;
his horse legs fast locked in deep &amp; tough clay.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span></p>

<p>Then hee was committed to straight and
close prison, his eyes put out (as if hee should
not see his miserie) and a sure guard set vpon
him. Thus he remained in desolate darkenesse;
neither reuerenced by any for his former greatnesse,
not pitied for his present distresse. Thus
hee continued about 27. yeeres, in a life farre
more grieuous then death; euen vntill the yere
before the death of King <i>Henrie</i>. So long was
he a suitor in wooing of death: so long did the
one brother ouerliue his good fortune, the other
his good nature and disposition; esteeming
it a faire fauour, that the vttermost extremitie
was not inflicted. Albeit some writers
doe affirme, that the Dukes eyes were not violently
put out, but that either through age or
infirmitie he fell blind: that he was honourably
attended and cared for: that hauing digested
in his iudgement the worst of his case, the
greatnesse of his courage did neuer descend to
any base degree of sorrow or griefe: that his
braue behauiour did set a Maiestie vpon his deiected
fortunes: that his noble heart like the
Sunne, did shew greatest co&#363;tenance in lowest
state. And to this report I am the more inclineable,
for that it agreeth best, both to the faire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
conditions, and to the former behauiours, and
to the succeeding fortunes and felicities of the
King: For assuredly hee had a heart of manly
clemencie; and this was a punishment barbarously
cruell: For which cause <i>Constantine</i><a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> did
forbid, that the face of man, adorned with Celestiall
beauty, should be deformed for any offence.</p>

<p>Others auow that he was neuer blind; but
that it was the Earle of <i>Mortaigne</i> whose eyes
were put out. And this seemeth to be confirmed,
by that which <i>Matth. Paris</i> and <i>Matth.
Westm.</i> doe report. That not long before the
death of <i>Robert</i>, the King vpon a festiuall day
had a new robe of Scarlet brought vnto him:
the cape whereof being somewhat too streight
for his head, he did teare a little in striuing to
put it on. And perceiuing that it would not
serue, hee laid it aside and said: <i>Let my brother
Robert haue this Robe, for whose head it is fitter
then for mine</i>. When it was caried vnto him,
being then not perfectly in health, he espied the
crackt place, and thereupon enquired, if any
man had worne it before? The messenger declared
the whole matter. Which when <i>Robert</i>
heard, he tooke it for a great indignitie, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
said: <i>I perceiue now that I haue liued too long, that
my brother doth clothe me like his almoseman, with
cast and torne garments</i>. So hee grew weary of
his life: and his disease encreasing with his discontentment,
pined away, and in short time after
died, and was buried at <i>Glocester</i>.</p>

<p>And this was the end of that excellent
commander; brought to this game and gaze
of fortune, after many trauerses that he had
troden. He was for courage and direction inferiour
to none; but neither prouident nor constant
in his affaires, whereby the true end of his
actions were ouerthrowen. His valour had triumphed
ouer desperate dangers: and verely
he was no more setled in valour, then disposed
to vertue and goodnesse; neuer wilfully or
willingly doing euill, neuer but by errour, as
finding it disguised vnder some maske of goodnesse.
His performances in armes had raised
him to a high point of opinion for his prowesse;
which made him the more vnhappy, as vnhappie
after a fall from high state of honor. He had
one sonne named <i>William</i>, vpon whose birth
the mother died: of this <i>William</i> shall somewhat
hereafter be said.</p>

<p>And now, as Princes oftentimes doe make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
aduantage of the calamity of their neighbours,
so vpon this downefall of the Duke of <i>Normandie</i>,<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>
<i>Fulke</i> Earle of <i>Aniou</i> sharing for himselfe, seized
vpon <i>Maine</i>, and certain other places; made
large waste, tooke great booties and spoyles;
not onely out of ancient and almost hereditary
hate against the house of <i>Normandie</i>, but as fearing
harme from the King of <i>England</i>, hee endeauoured
to harme him first. In like sort <i>Baldwine</i>
Earle of <i>Flanders</i> declared in armes against
the King for a yeerely pension of 300. markes;
the occasion of which demand was this. King
<i>William</i> the first, in recompence of the ayde
which he receiued in his enterprise for <i>England</i>,
from <i>Baldwine</i> 5. Earle of <i>Flanders</i>, payd him
yeerely three hundred markes, which after his
death was continued to his sonne. <i>Robert</i> Earle
of <i>Flanders</i> from a collaterall line, demanded
the same Pension; but it was denied him by K.
<i>Henrie</i>: wherefore <i>Baldwine</i> his sonne attempted
now to recouer it by Armes.</p>

<p>With these, or rather as principall of these,
<i>Lewes</i> the grosse King of <i>France</i>, seeing his ouersight
in permitting <i>Normandie</i> to bee annexed
to the Realme of <i>England</i>, assembled a
great armie; and vpon pretence of a trifling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
quarrell about the demolishing of the Castle
of <i>Gisors</i>, declared <i>William</i> sonne to <i>Robert
Curtcuise</i> for Duke of <i>Normandie</i>: and vndertooke
to place him in possession of that state,
which his vnfortunate father had lost. And besides
those open hostilities in Armes, <i>Hugh</i> the
kings Chamberlaine and certaine others were
suborned traiterously to kill the King: but the
practise was in good time discouered, and the
conspirators punished by death.</p>

<p>Hereupon the King both with celeritie and
power answerable to the danger at hand,
passed the Seas into <i>Normandie</i>: hauing first
drawen to his assistance <i>Theobald</i> Earle of
<i>Champaine</i>, the Earles of <i>Crecie</i>, <i>Pissaux</i>, and
<i>Dammartine</i>, who aspired to be absolute Lords
within their territories, as were many other
Princes at that time in <i>France</i>. These deteined
the <i>French</i> King in some tariance in <i>France</i>,
whilest the King of <i>England</i> either recouered or
reuenged his losses against the Earle of <i>Aniou</i>.
At the last hee was assailed in <i>Normandie</i> on
three parts at once: by the Earle of <i>Aniou</i> from
<i>Maine</i>, from <i>Ponthieu</i> by the Earle of <i>Flanders</i>,
and by the <i>French</i> King betweene both. The
King of <i>England</i> appointed certaine forces to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
guard the passages against the Earle of <i>Aniou</i>:
with directions to hold themselues within their
strength, and not to aduenture into the field.
Against the Earle of <i>Flanders</i> hee went in person;
and in a sharpe shocke betweene them
the Earle was defeated and hurt, and (as some
Authors affirme) slaine: albeit others doe report,
that hee was afterwards slaine in a battaile
betweene the two Kings of <i>England</i> and
of <i>France</i>.</p>

<p>After this he turned against <i>Lewes</i> King of
<i>France</i>, and fought with him before the towne
of <i>Nice</i> in <i>Normandie</i>; which towne the <i>French</i>
had surprised and taken from the King of <i>England</i>.
This battaile continued aboue the space
of nine houres, with incredible obstinacie; the
doubt of victory being no lesse great, then was
the desire: and yet neither part so hastie to
end, as not to stay for the best aduantage. The
first battaile on both sides was hewen in pieces;
valour of inestimable value was there cast away:
much braue blood was lost; many men
esteemed both for their place and worth, lay
groaning and grinning vnder the heauy hand
of death. The sad blowes, the grisle wounds,
the grieuous deathes that were dealt that day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
might well haue moued any man to haue said,
That warre is nothing else but inhumane manhood.</p>

<p>The Kings courage, guided with his Fortune,
and guarded both with his strength and
his skill, was neuer idle, neuer but working memorable
effects. In all places his directions
were followed by his presence; being witnesse
both of the diligence and valour of euery man,
and not suffering any good aduantage or aduise
for want of timely taking to be lost. He aduentured
so farre in perfourming with his
hand, that his armour in many places was battered
to his body, and by reason of the sturdie
strokes set vpon his helme, he cast blood out
of his mouth. But this was so farre from dismaying
his powers, that it did rather assemble
and vnite them: so as aduancing his braue
head, his furie did breath such vigour into his
arme, that his sword made way through the
thickest throngs of his enemies, and hee brake
into them euen to the last ranckes. He was first
seconded by the truely valiant; whose vndanted
spirits did assure the best, and therewith
contemne the very worst. Then came in they
whom despaire, the last of resolutions had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
made valiant; who discerned no meanes of
hope for life, but by bold aduenturing vpon
death. Lastly he was followed by all; being enflamed
by this example to a new life of resolution.
Generally, the swords went so fast, that the
<i>French</i> vnable to endure that deadly storme,
were vtterly disbanded and turned to flight.
K. <i>Henry</i> after a bloody chase, recouered <i>Nice</i>;
and with great triumph returned to <i>Roan</i>.
Afterwards he would often say, That in other
battailes he fought for victory, but in this for his
life: and that hee would but little ioy in many
such victories.</p>

<p>Vpon this euent the King sent certaine forces
into <i>France</i>, to harrase the countrey, and to
strike a terrour into the enemie. The <i>French</i>
King, besides the abatement of his power by
reason of his late ouerthrow, was then preparing
in Armes against <i>Henry</i> the Emperour,
who intended to destroy <i>Rhemes</i>: partly
drawen on by <i>Henry</i> King of <i>England</i>, whose
daughter he had taken to wife; but chiefly for
that a Councell had bene there held against
him by Pope <i>Calixtus</i> a French man, wherein
the Emperour was declared enemie to the
Church, and degraded from his Imperiall dig<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>nitie.
This brought the <i>English</i> to a carelesse
conceit, and to a loose and licentious demeanure
in their action; a most assured token of
some mischiefe at hand. And so, as they scattered
and ranged after prey (as greedy men are
seldome circumspect) they were suddenly set
vpon by <i>Almaricke</i> Earle of <i>Mountfort</i>, appointed
by the <i>French</i> K. to defend the Country, &amp;
with no small execution put to the chase. The
more they resisted, the greater was their losse:
The sooner they fled, the more assured was
their escape. And for that they were dispersed
into many small companies, they had the better
opportunitie to saue themselues.</p>

<p>Many other like aduentures were enterprised
betweene the two Kings and their adherents;
some in <i>France</i>, and some in <i>Normandie</i>;
with large losse on both sides. But especially
the King of <i>France</i> was most subiect to harme;
for that his countrey was the more ample, open
and rich. The King of <i>England</i> held this aduantage,
that no aduantage could be wonne against
him: which in regard of the number, valour
and greatnesse of his enemies, was a very
honourable aduantage indeed.</p>

<p>At the last he made peace with the Earle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
<i>Aniou</i>; taking the Earles daughter to be wife
to his sonne <i>William</i>, whom he had declared
for successour in his estate; to whom all the
Nobilitie and Prelates were sworne; and who
seemed to want nothing through all his fathers
dominions, but onely the name and Title of
King. This sinew being cut from the King of
<i>France</i>, and also for that <i>Henry</i> the Emperour
made preparation of hostilitie against him, he
fell likewise to agreement of peace. By the conditions
whereof, <i>William</i> sonne to the King of
<i>England</i> was inuested into the Duchie of <i>Normandie</i>,
doing homage for the same to the K. of
<i>France</i>. In this peace was comprised on the part
of the <i>French</i> K. <i>Willi&#257;</i> son to <i>Robert Curtcuise</i>,
who had bene declared Duke of <i>Normandie</i>.
On the part of the king of <i>England</i>, the Earle of
<i>Champeigne</i> and certaine other Lords were
comprised; who had either serued or aided him
against the king of <i>France</i>. After this the warres
betweene the Emperour and the <i>French</i> king
did forthwith dissolue.</p>

<p>King <i>Henry</i> hauing happily finished these
affaires, returned out of <i>Normandie</i>, and loosing
from <i>Barbeflote</i>, vpon the 24. of Nouember
towards euening, with a prosperous gale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
arriued in <i>England</i>; where great preparation
was made to entertaine him with many well
deuised honours. His sonne <i>William</i> then duke
of <i>Normandie</i>, and somewhat aboue 17. yeeres
of age, tooke another ship; and in his company
went <i>Mary</i> his sister Countesse of <i>Perch</i>, <i>Richard</i>
his brother, begotten of a concubine as
some affirme; and the Earle of <i>Chester</i> with his
wife <i>Lucie</i>, who was the Kings niece by his sister
<i>Adela</i>. Also the yong Nobilitie and best
knights flocked vnto him, some to discharge
their dueties, others to testifie their loue and
respect. Of such passengers the ship receiued to
the number of 140. besides 50. sailers which belonged
vnto her.</p>

<p>So they loosed from land somewhat after
the King; and with a gentle winde from the
Southwest, danced through the soft swelling
floods. The sailers full of proud ioy, by reason
of their honourable charge; and of little feare
or forecast, both for that they had bene accustomed
to dangers, and for that they were then
well tippeled with wine; gaue forth in a brauery,
that they would soone outstrip the vessell
wherein the King sailed. In the middest of this
drunken ioylitie the ship strake against a rocke,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
the head whereof was aboue water, not farre
from the shoare. The passengers cried out, and
the sailers laboured to winde or beare off the
ship from the danger; but the labour was no
lesse vaine then the cry: for she leaned so stiffely
against the rocke, that the sterage brake, the
sides cracked, and the Sea gushed in at many
breaches.</p>

<p>Then was raised a lamentable cry within the
ship; some yeelding to the tyrannie of despaire,
betooke themselues (as in cases of extremitie
weake courages are wont) to their deuotions;
others emploied all industrie to saue their liues,
and yet more in duetie to nature, then vpon
hope to escape: all bewailed the vnfortunate
darkenesse of that night, the last to the liues of
so many persons both of honour and of worth.
They had nothing to acc&#333;pany them but their
feares, nothing to helpe them but their wishes:
the confused cries of them al, did much increase
the particular astonishment of euery one. And
assuredly no danger dismayeth like that vpon
the seas; for that the place is vnnaturall to
man. And further, the vnusuall obiects, the
continuall motion, the desolation of all helpe
or hope, will perplexe the minds euen of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
who are best armed against discouragement.</p>

<p>At the last the boat was hoysed foorth, and
the Kings sonne taken into it. They had cleered
themselues from the danger of the ship, and
might safely haue rowed to land. But the yong
Prince hearing the shrill shrikes of his Sister
<i>Mary</i> Countesse of <i>Perch</i>, and of the Countesse
of <i>Chester</i> his cousin, crying after him, and crauing
his help; he preferred pitie before safety, &amp;
commanded the boat to be rowed back to the
ship for preseruation of their liues. But as they
approached, the boate was suddenly so ouercharged
with those, who (strugling to breake
out of the armes of death) leaped at all aduentures
into it, that it sunke vnder them:
and so all the company perished by drowning.
Onely one ordinary Sayler, who had been a
butcher, by swimming all night vpon the mast
escaped to land; reserued as it may seeme, to
relate the manner of the misaduenture. This
ship raised much matter of nouelty and discourse
abroad; but neuer did ship bring such
calamitie to the Realme: especially for that it
was iudged, that the life of this Prince would
haue preuented those intestine warres, which
afterwards did fall, betweene King <i>Steuen</i> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
<i>Matild</i> daughter to King <i>Henry</i>. The King was
so ouercharged with this heauy accident; that
his reason seemed to bee darkened, or rather
drowned in sorrow. Hee caused the coasts a
long time after to bee watched; but scarce any
of the bodies were euer found. Afterwards he
tooke to wife <i>Adalisia</i> daughter to <i>Godfrey</i>
Duke of <i>Louaine</i>, of the house of <i>Lorraine</i>:
She was crowned at <i>Westminster</i> by <i>Roger</i> B.
of <i>Salisburie</i>, because <i>Radulph</i> Archbishop
of <i>Canterburie</i>, by reason of his palsey was vnable
to performe that office. And yet because
<i>Roger</i> was not appointed by him, the doting
old man fell into such a pelting chafe, that hee
offered to strike the Kings Crowne from his
head. And albeit this Lady was in the principall
flower both of her beauty and yeeres, yet
the King had no issue by her.</p>

<p>Now as after a storme a fewe gentle drops
doe alwayes fall, before the weather turnes
perfectly fayre, so after these great warres in
<i>France</i>, certaine easie conflicts did ensue: neither
dangerous nor almost troublesome to the
King. For <i>Robert</i> Earle of <i>Mellent</i>, who for a
long time had continued both a sure friend,
and most close and priuate in counsaile with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
the King, vpon some sudden either discontentment
on his part, or dislike on the Kings, so estranged
himselfe, as it was enterpreted to be a
reuolt: being charged with intent, to aduance
<i>William</i>, cousin to <i>William</i>, sonne to <i>Robert
Curtcuise</i>, to the Duchie of <i>Normandie</i>.
Wherefore the King besieged, and at last
tooke his chiefe Castle called <i>Pont. Audomer</i>;
and at the same time enuironed the towre
of <i>Roan</i> with a wall. He also repaired and fortified
the Castles of <i>Caen</i>, <i>Arches</i>, <i>Gisore</i>, <i>Falace</i>,
<i>Argentine</i>, <i>Donfronç</i>, <i>Oxine</i>, <i>Aubrois</i>, <i>Nanroye</i>,
<i>Iuta</i>, and the Towne of <i>Vernone</i> in such sort, as
at that time, they were esteemed impregnable,
and not to bee forced by any enemie; except
God or gold.</p>

<p>In the meane time the Earle of <i>Mellent</i>, with
<i>Hugh Geruase</i> his sonne, and <i>Hugh de Mountfort</i>
his sisters sonne, calling such as either
alliance or friendship did draw vnto them; besides
those whom youthful either age or minds
had filled with vnlimited desires; whom discontentment
also or want did vainly feed with
hungry hopes; entred into <i>Normandy</i> in armes:
being so transported with desire to hurt, and
troubled with feare of receiuing hurt, that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
had neuer free scope of iudgement, either to
prepare or manage the meanes to hurt. They
were no sooner entred the Confines of <i>Normandie</i>,
but <i>William Tankeruill</i> the kings Chamberlaine
came against them, brauely appointed,
and resolute to fight. The very view of
an enemie turned their euill guided furie into
a feare: and whatsoeuer they did (proceeding
rather from violence of passion then ground of
reason) made them stumble whilest they ran,
and by their owne disorders hindered their
owne desires. So with small difficultie they
were surprised and taken, and brought to the
King; who committed them to streit prison at
<i>Roan</i>. An ordinary euent when rage runneth
faster, then iudgement and power are able to
hold pace.</p>

<p>About this time <i>Charles</i> Earle of <i>Flanders</i> as
he was at his deuotions in the Church of S. <i>Donatus</i>
in <i>Bruxels</i>, was suddenly slaine by conspiracie
of his owne people. And because hee
left no issue in life, <i>Lewes</i> King of <i>France</i> inuested
<i>William</i> sonne to <i>Robert Curtcuis</i> late Duke
of <i>Normandie</i>, in the Earledome of <i>Flanders</i>; as
descended from Earle <i>Baldwine</i> sirnamed the
Pious, whose daughter <i>Matilde</i> was wife to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
King <i>William</i> the first, and grandmother to this
<i>William</i>. This he did, not so much in fauour to
<i>William</i>, or in regard of his right, as to set vp an
assured enemie against King <i>Henry</i>: an enemie
not onely of singular expectation, but proofe:
whose courage was apt to vndertake any danger;
whether for glory, or for reuenge. And
herein his proiect did nothing faile. For no sooner
was the Earle aduanced to that estate, but
he raised a great hostilitie against the King of
<i>England</i>: as well to recouer the Duchie of <i>Normandie</i>,
as either to relieue or to reuenge the
hard captiuitie of his father.</p>

<p>In this warre the Earle did winne a great
opinion, both for iudgement to discerne, and
for valour to execute what hee did discerne:
shewing himselfe in nothing inferiour to his
vnckle the king, but onely in treasure and command
of men. For this cause he craued supply
of <i>Lewes</i> king of <i>France</i>; who, as he was the
first that blew the cole, so was he alwayes ready
to put fuell to the flame. But the King of <i>England</i>
entered <i>France</i> with a strong Armie, where
his sword ranged and raged without resistance:
and yet more in prosecution of prey, then in
execution of blood. He lodged at <i>Hesperdune</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
the space of 8. dayes; no lesse quietly, no lesse
safely, then if he had bene in the principall Citie
of his kingdome. By this meanes hee kept
the <i>French</i> King from sending succour to the
Earle of <i>Flanders</i>. And in the meane season
drew <i>Theodoricke</i> Earle of <i>Holsteine</i>, nephew to
<i>Robert</i> who had bene Earle of <i>Flanders</i>, and <i>Arnoldus</i>
sisters sonne to Earle <i>Charles</i>, not long
before slaine, to inuade Earle <i>William</i>: Both
pretending title to his dignitie, both bringing
seueral armies, consisting of men, tough in temper,
and well exercised in affaires of the field.</p>

<p><i>Theodorick</i> vpon his first approch tooke <i>Bruges</i>,
<i>Ipres</i> and <i>Gandt</i>; either willingly yeelding,
or with small resistance: and vpon the necke
thereof <i>Arnoldus</i> tooke the strong towne of S.
<i>Omer</i>. Earle <i>William</i> being thus set as it were
betweene the beetle and the blocke, was nothing
deiected, nothing dismayed, either in
courage or in hope. And first he went against
<i>Arnoldus</i>, with a small company, but with such
a liuely countenance of a Souldier, that <i>Arnoldus</i>
fell to capitulation for his safe departure;
and so returned home as if he had bene vanquished.
Then the Earle made head against
<i>Theodorick</i>, and gaue him battaile, albeit farre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
inferiour to him, both for number and furniture
of his men. The fight betweene them was
long, furious and doubtfull. The <i>Germans</i> confident
in their number, which made them trust
the lesse to their valour: the <i>Flemings</i> rather desperate
then resolute, vpon importance of their
danger. And indeed it often happeneth, that
good successe at the first doeth occasion the ouerthrow
of many great actions: by working in
the one side a confidence in themselues, and
contempt of their enemies; and by making the
other more earnest and entire. So at the last
the violent valour of the Earle, well followed
with the braue and resolute rage of his Souldiers,
did such effects, that the <i>Germans</i> were shaken
and disordered, many slaine in the field,
and the residue chased out of <i>Flanders</i>.</p>

<p>The Earle hauing now no enemie in open
field, layed siege to the castle of <i>Alhurst</i>, which
was defended against him by the <i>English</i>. The
assaults were so liuely enforced, and with such
varietie of inuention and deuise; that a wide
way was opened through all impediments, and
the defendants were constrained by many necessities,
to desire faire conditions of yeelding.
This whilest the Earle delayed to grant, he re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>ceiued
in a certaine light c&#333;flict a wound in his
hand, whereof in a short time after he died: hauing
first raised himselfe very high in opinion
with all men, for his courage, industrie and skill
in Armes. And thus Duke <i>Robert</i> and his
sonne <i>William</i> were brought to their vnhappy
ends; rather through the malice of their Fortune,
then through any bad merit or insufficiencie
in themselues: whereby the Duchie of
<i>Normandie</i>, which had bene both the cause
and the seate of very great warres, was then
strongly setled in possession of King <i>Henry</i>.</p>

<p>Hee was neuer infested with domesticall
warres; which in regard of those tumultuous
times, is a manifest argument both of his iustice
and prouidence; the one not giuing cause,
the other no hope, for his subiects to rebel. The
King of <i>Scots</i> did homage vnto him; for what
territories I doe not determine. <i>Morcard</i> King
of <i>Ireland</i> and some of his successors were so appliable
vnto him, that they seemed to depend
vpon his command. The <i>Welsh</i> who hated idlenesse
and peace alike, did striue beyond their
strength to pull their feete out of the mire of
subiection; but in loose straggling companies,
without either discipline or head. For this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
cause hee made diuers expeditions into <i>Wales</i>,
where he had many bickerings, and put many
chases vpon them: but found nothing worthy
the name, either of enemie or of warre. Wherefore
by maintaining garrisons, and light troups
of Souldiers, he consumed the most obstinate,
and reduced the rest to his allegeance: receiuing
the sonnes of their Nobilitie for hostages.</p>

<p>At that time many Flemings inhabited in
<i>England</i>; of whom some came ouer in the time
of King <i>William</i> the first, by occasion of his mariage
with <i>Matild</i> daughter to <i>Baldwine</i> their
Earle: but the greatest part came vnder the
reigne of this King <i>Henrie</i>, by reason that <i>Flanders</i>
at that time by irruption of the sea, was in
many places ouerflowen. The King was willing
to entertaine them, because they brought
with them both industrie and trades; because
they made the Countrey both populous and
rich. For in making a place populous, it is thereby
also made rich: draw people to a place, and
plentie will follow; driue away people, and it is
vndone. They were first planted neere the riuer
of <i>Tweede</i>; besides those who dispersed into
diuers Townes. But at this time the King
sent many of them into <i>Rose</i> in <i>Pembrokeshire</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
whose progeny did euer since maintaine themselues
in good condition against the <i>Welsh</i>: being
a people euen at this day distinguished
from all other bordering vpon them, both in
language, and in nature, and in fashion of
life.</p>

<p>On a time as the king marched through
<i>Powesland</i> in <i>Southwales</i>, hee came to certaine
streights, through which his maine army could
not passe, by reason of their multitude and
traine of cariage: wherefore hee sent the greatest
part a further way about, and himselfe with
a small company tooke the neerer way thorow
those streights. When he was well entred, he
was charged very sharpely, but rudely, and disordredly
by the <i>Welsh</i>; who hauing the aduantage
both in number and in place, did
much annoy him from the higher ground; but
durst not approach to close fight at hand. The
King himselfe was smitten with an arrow full
vpon the breast: whereat hee swore <i>By our
Lords death</i> (which was his vsuall oath) that
it was no <i>Welsh</i> arme which shot that arrow.
Many of his men also were hurt, and the residue
strangely disordred; the amazement being
farre greater then the distresse. But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
king with a firme countenance retired in
time, the enemies not daring to pursue him any
further, then they might be assured by aduantage
of place. Then he sent peaceably vnto
them, and after some ouertures, brought
them to agree, that for a thousand head of cattell
the passage should be left open vnto him.</p>


<p class="p2">In his politicke gouernment he so managed
the State, that neither subiects wanted iustice,
nor Prince obedience. He repaired many
defects, hee reformed many abuses, which
would in the meane time enfeeble, and at last
oppresse the Common-wealth. Hee ordred
his affaires with such moderation, that he was
not onely well obeyed by his subiects, but highly
honoured and respected by forreine Princes:
wherby it appeared, that learning may be both
a guard and guide to Princes, if it be not so immoderately
affected, as to bereaue them, either
of the minde, or time for action. He vsed much
seueritie in punishing offenders; seueritie, the
life of iustice; of iustice, the most assured preseruer
of States: affording no more fauour for
the most part, then dead mercilesse law did allot.
Against theeues he prouided, that no mo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>ney
should saue them from hanging. He ordeined
that counterfeitures of money should
loose both their eyes, and be depriued of their
priuie parts. He tooke away the deceit which
had been occasioned by varietie of measures,
and made a measure by the length of his owne
arme: which hath been Commonly vsed euer
since by the name of a yard.</p>

<p>And wheras there are two infallible signes of
a diseased State; excesse in eating, and in attire;
which could neuer be restrained by penalties or
feare, but the more the people are therin forbidden,
the more are they rauished into riot and
vanitie: the King by two meanes cast a general
restraint vpon them both: by example, and by
reproofe: which by reason of the inclination of
men to imitate and please their Prince, haue alwayes
been of greater force then lawes, to reforme
abuses in that kind. He much abhorred
excesse in eating and drinking, and was so moderate
in his owne diet, that he seemed to feede
onely for necessitie of nature. Hee both vsed
and commended ciuill modestie in apparell:
especially he could not endure an absurd abuse
of men in those times, in wearing long haire
like vnto women. And when their owne haire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
failed, they set artificiall <i>Peruques</i>,<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> with long
locks vpon their heads; whereas by censure of
the Apostle, it is reprochfull for men to weare
long haire. He discharged his Court of many
loose lasciuious persons; affirming, that they
were no good instruments of the kingdome; as
being in peace chargeable, and vnprofitable for
warre.</p>

<p>During his absence in <i>Normandie</i>, which
was sometimes three or foure yeeres together,
he committed the gouernement of his Realme
to <i>Roger</i> Bishop of <i>Salisburie</i>: A man harmelesse
in life, in mind flourishing and fresh, in intention
vpright: most wise in taking, and most
faithfull and fortunate in giuing aduise. Hee
had gouerned the Kings expenses of house
when hee was but a Prince of priuate estate;
whereby he gained that reputation for integritie
and skill, which aduanced him to a higher
trust. He was Doctor of the Canon and Ciuill
lawes, as most of the Bishops at that time
were, and did beare the title and name of <i>Iusticiarius
totius Angliæ</i>. Hee built the <i>Deuises</i>
in <i>Wiltshire</i>, the Castles of <i>Malmesburie</i> and
<i>Shireburne</i>. He repaired the Castle of <i>Salisburie</i>,
and enuironed the same with a wall; hee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
built the stately Church at <i>Salisburie</i>, destined
to a longer life then any of his other workes.
And further, by reason of the Kings much abode
in <i>Normandie</i>, the prouisions of his
house were valued at certaine prices, and receiued
in money, to the great contentment and
ease of the people.</p>

<p>In these times were mighty woods about
the place where the two high wayes <i>Watling</i>
and <i>Ikening</i> doe ioyne together; which woods
were a safe couert and retreite for many robbers,
who much infested those high wayes.
The most famous thiefe among them, was named
<i>Dunne</i>,<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> a man mischieuous without mercie,
equally greedie of blood and of spoile, the
first infamie of his name: Hee was in a sort as
the most villanously aduentrous and vile; (for
in lewd actions, the worst are greatest) Commander
ouer the rest, and of him the place was
called <i>Dunstable</i>. To represse this annoyance,
the King caused the woods to bee cut downe,
built there a Borough, to which hee granted
Faire &amp; Market, and that the Burgesses should
be so free as any other Burgesses within the
Realme. Hee erected there also a Palace for
himselfe, and also a faire Church or Priorie;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
whereto he gaue large priuiledges and endowments.
By these meanes hee made the place
first populous, and consequently both plentifull
and safe.</p>

<p>Many other royall workes hee performed,
some for Religion, as the Religious buildings
specified before; some for strength, as diuers
Castles in <i>Normandie</i>, in <i>Wales</i>, and some also
in <i>England</i>: and namely the Castle of <i>Warwicke</i>,
of <i>Bristoll</i>, the Castle Colledge and Towne of
<i>Windsore</i> on the hill, about a mile distant from
the old Towne of <i>Windsore</i>; which afterward
was much encreased by King <i>Edward</i> the third,
and after him by many Kings and Queenes
succeeding. Many Palaces also he built for ornament
&amp; pleasure. And to this end he maintained
his Parke at <i>Woodstocke</i>, wherein hee
preserued diuers sorts of
strange beasts; which because he did with many
demonstrations of pleasure both accept
and esteeme, were liberally sent vnto him from
other Princes.</p>

<p>Hee first instituted the forme of the high
Court of Parliament, as now it is in vse. For before
his time, onely certaine of the Nobilitie
and Prelats of the Realme were called to con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>sultation
about the most important affaires of
state: he caused the commons also to be assembled,
by Knights and Burgesses of their owne
appointment, and made that Court to consist
of three parts; the Nobilitie, the Clergie, and
the Common people; representing the whole
body of the Realme. The first Councell of this
sort was held at <i>Salisbury</i>, vpon the 19. day of
April, in the 16. yeere of his reigne.</p>

<p>His seueritie in iustice, the very heart string
of a Common-wealth, his heauie hand in bearing
downe his enemies, in disabling those from
working him harme whom he knew would neuer
loue him at the heart; was traduced by
some vnder termes of crueltie. And yet was he
alwayes more mindfull of benefits then of
wrongs; and in offences of highest nature, euen
for bearing Armes against him, he punished
oftentimes by imprisonment or exile, and not
by death.</p>

<p>When <i>Matilde</i> his daughter was giuen in
mariage to <i>Henry</i> the fifth Emperour, he tooke
3. shillings of euery hide of land throughout
the Realme: which being followed by succeeding
Kings, did grow to a custome of receiuing
ayd, whensoeuer they gaue their daughters in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
marriage. For albeit the same be found in the
great <i>Custumier</i> of <i>Normandie</i>, yet was it neuer
practised in <i>England</i> before. This happened in
the fifteenth yeere of his reigne: and he neuer
had the like contribution after, but one for
furnishing his warres in <i>France</i>. So the people
were not charged with many extraordinary
taxations, but their ordinary fines and payments
were very great; and yet not very grieuous
vnto them. For that they saw them expended,
not in wanton wast, not in loose and
immoderate liberalitie, but either vpon necessitie,
or for the honour &amp; dignitie of the state:
wherein the preseruation or aduancement of
the common good, made particular burthens
not almost sensible.</p>

<p>But both his actions and exactions were most
displeasing to the Clergy; the Clergy did often
times not onely murmure, but struggle and oppose
against his actions: as taking their liberties
to be infringed, and their state diminished; by
abasing their authority, and abating both their
riches and power. When any Bishopricke or
Abbey fell voyd, hee did apply the reuenues
thereof for supply of his necessities and wants:
and for that cause kept some of them many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
yeeres together vacant in his hands. He would
not permit appeales to <i>Rome</i>. Canons were
not of force within the Realme, vnlesse they
were confirmed by the King. Legats from the
Pope were not obeyed; and no man would
come to their conuocations. In so much as one
of the Popes Legates in <i>France</i> did excommunicate
all the Priests of <i>Normandy</i>, because they
would not come to his Synode. For this cause
the King sent the Bishop of <i>Exceter</i> to <i>Rome</i>,
albeit he was both blind and in yeeres, to treat
with the Pope concerning that businesse. Hee
gaue inuestitures to Prelates, by Crosse, Ring
and Staffe: and is charged to haue receiued of
some of them great summes of money for their
places. About this time the marriage of Priests
was forbidden in <i>England</i>; but the King for
money permitted them to reteine their wiues,
and in the end set an imposition in that respect
vpon euery Church throughout the Realme.
It auailed not any man to say, that he had no
purpose to keepe a wife: he must pay for a facultie
to keepe a wife if he would.</p>

<p>For these causes they fastened the infamie
of couetousnesse vpon him. For these causes
and especially for inuesting and receiuing ho<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>mage
of Prelats, he had a stiffe strife with <i>Anselme</i>
Archb. of <i>Canterburie</i>. For the King said,
that it was against the custome of his ancesters,
it could not stand with the safety of his State;
that the Prelats, who at that time held the principall
places both of trust and command in his
kingdome, who in very deed ruled all the rest,
should not be appointed onely by himselfe;
should not sweare faith and allegiance vnto
him; should either bee aduanced or depend
vpon any forren Prince. On the other side <i>Anselme</i>
refused, not onely to confirme, but to
communicate or common friendly with those
who had bene inuested by the King: reproching
them, as abortiues and children of destruction;
traducing the King also, as a defiler of
Religion, as a deformer of the beautie and dignitie
of the Church. Hereupon by appointment
of the King, they were confirmed &amp; consecrated
by the Archb. of <i>Yorke</i>. Onely <i>William
Gifford</i>, to whom the K. had giuen the Bishopricke
of <i>Winchester</i>, refused Consecration from
the Archb. of <i>Yorke</i>; for which cause the King
depriued him of all his goods, and banished
him out of the Realme.</p>

<p>Then the King required <i>Anselme</i> to doe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
him homage, and to be present with him at giuing
Inuestitures; as <i>Lanfranck</i> his predecessor
had bene with King <i>William</i> his father. Against
these demaunds <i>Anselme</i> obiected the decrees
of the Councell lately held at <i>Rome</i>; whereby
all Lay-persons were excommunicate, who
should conferre any Spiritual promotions; and
all those accursed, who for Ecclesiasticall dignities,
should subiect themselues vnder the homage
or seruice of any Lay-man. Hereupon
messengers were dispatched from both parties
to the Pope: who determined altogether in fauour
of <i>Anselme</i>, or rather in fauour of himselfe.
Notwithstanding the king desisted not to vrge
<i>Anselme</i>, to sweare homage vnto him. <i>Anselme</i>
required, that the Popes letters should bee
brought foorth; and he would doe as by them
hee should be directed. The King answered,
that he had nothing to doe with the Popes letters;
that this was a Soueraigne right of his
Crowne; that if any man may pull these Royalties
from his Crowne, he may easily pull his
Crowne from his head: that therefore <i>Anselme</i>
must doe him homage, or else depart out of his
kingdome. <i>Anselme</i> answered, that hee would
not depart out of the Realme, but goe home to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
his Church, and there see, who would offer
him violence.</p>

<p>Then were messengers againe sent to the
Bishop of <i>Rome</i>; two Bishops from the King,
and two Monckes from <i>Anselme</i>. The King
wrote to the Pope, first congratulating his aduancement
to the Sea of <i>Rome</i>; then desiring
the continuance of that amitie which had bene
betweene their predecessours; Lastly, he tendred
all honour and obedience, which in former
times the Kings of <i>England</i> did yeeld to
the See of <i>Rome</i>; desiring againe, that he might
not be abridged of such vsages as his father did
enioy: concluding, that during his life, hee
would not suffer the dignities of his Crowne
to be empaired; and if he should so doe, yet the
Nobilitie and common people of the Realme
would in no case permit it, but would rather
recede from obedience to his See.</p>

<p>The Pope wrote backe againe to <i>Anselme</i>;
that for one mans pleasure hee would not reuerse
the decrees of former Popes; and therefore
gaue him both encouragement &amp; charge,
to continue constant, and to see them obserued
in euery point. Hee directed also his letters to
the King, which the King did suppresse: but his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
Embassadours declared by word, that the Pope
permitted Inuestitures to the King, so as in other
things hee would execute the Office of a
good Prince. <i>Anselme</i> called for the Popes letters.
The King answered, that his Bishops
were to be credited before the Monckes, who
were disabled either for voyce or testimonie in
Secular affaires. <i>Anselme</i> said, that he was desirous
to yeeld vnto the King, but he durst not
although it should cost him his head, vnlesse
he had a warrant from <i>Rome</i>: and therefore he
would send thither againe, to haue a more full
and ample answere. The King and diuers of
the Nobilitie perswaded him to goe in person,
to trauaile to the Pope, and to trauaile with
him, for the quiet of the Church, and of his
countrey. With much adoe he was entreated,
and so set forth on his iourney towards <i>Rome</i>:
and after followed the kings Embassadour <i>William
Warlewast</i>, new elect Bishop of <i>Exceter</i>.</p>

<p>When the Bishop came to the Popes presence,
he declared vnto him; what great commodities
did rise out of <i>England</i> to the See of
<i>Rome</i>; that the Inuesting of Prelats had bene
an ancient right to the crowne of that Realme;
that as the King was by nature liberall, so was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
he stout and resolute in courage, that it should
be a great dishonour to him, who in power exceeded
any of his ancesters, if hee should not
maintaine the dignities which they held; that
for this cause the Pope should doe well to preferre
to his consideration, what preiudice
might follow to his Estate, if hee should remit
nothing of the seuerities of those Canons which
had bene lately made.</p>

<p>The Pope gaue an attentiue eare, and seemed
to pause vpon that which had been sayd.
Which the Kings Ambassadour taking to be a
degree of yeelding, did more earnestly insist,
and said: that the King his master would not
for the Crowne of his Realme, loose the authoritie
of inuesting his Prelates. Hereto the Pope
with a starting voice and countenance answered;
<i>Neither will I lose the disposing of spirituall
promotions in</i> England, <i>for the Kings head that
beareth the Crowne; before God</i> (said hee) <i>I aduow
it</i>. His flattering followers applauded this
speach, as proceeding from a magnanimous
courage, or rather as some flash of diuine inspiration:
and the Kings Ambassador not a little
abashed, was content to descend to lower demands.
In the ende it was ordered, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
King should be restored to certaine customes
which had been vsed by his father; but that all
they who had bin inuested by the King, should
be exc&#333;municate, &amp; that their satisfaction and
absolution should be committed vnto <i>Anselme</i>.</p>

<p>Thus <i>Anselme</i>, with full saile of victorie and
ioy returned towards <i>England</i>; but the Kings
Ambassadour stayed behind, to assay whether
by any meanes hee could worke the Pope to a
milder minde. But when hee saw that he trauailed
in vaine, he followed <i>Anselme</i>, and ouertooke
him at <i>Placentia</i>, and there deliuered vnto
him certaine priuate instructions from the
King: that if he would come into <i>England</i>, and
behaue himselfe as his predecessours had done
towards the Kings father, hee should be welcome;
otherwise, you are wise enough (said
hee) you know what I meane, and may easily
coniecture what will ensue. With these words
he flang suddenly away; by occasion whereof
his speaches setled with a more strong impression,
and multiplied many doubtfull constructions.
So the Embassadour returned to the King;
but <i>Anselme</i> went to <i>Lions</i>, and remained there
a yeere and halfe.</p>

<p>In the meane time much posting was made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
betweene <i>England</i>, <i>Lions</i>, and <i>Rome</i>; but nothing
was concluded, nothing could please: For
neither the Pope would yeeld to the King, nor
the King to <i>Anselme</i>. At the last <i>Anselme</i> threatned
to excommunicate the King: whereof the
King being aduertised by the Countesse <i>Adela</i>
his sister, hee desired her to come to him into
<i>Normandy</i>, and to bring <i>Anselme</i> with her. Here
the King restored <i>Anselme</i> to his former possessions;
but his returne into <i>England</i> was respited,
vntill the Pope had confirmed certaine things
which <i>Anselme</i> did assure. So the King tooke
his passage into <i>England</i>, and <i>Anselme</i> abode at
the Abbey of <i>Beck</i>. Then were dispatched for
<i>Rome</i>, <i>William Warlewast</i> mentioned before,
and <i>Baldwine</i> Abbot of <i>Ramsey</i>; by whose
meanes the controuersie was composed betweene
the King and the Pope; that the King
should receiue homage of Bishops elect, but
should not inuest them by Staffe and Ring.
After this the king went into <i>Normandie</i>, and
there agreed to <i>Anselme</i> in these points following.</p>

<blockquote><p>1 <i>That all his Churches which had been made
tributary to King <span class="f">William</span> the second should bee
set free.</i></p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span></p>

<p>2 <i>That the King should require nothing of
the sayd Churches, whilest the Sea should remaine
vacant.</i></p>

<p>3 <i>That such Priests as had giuen money to
the King to reteine their wiues, should surcease
from their function the space of three yeeres; and
that the king should take no more after such maner.</i></p>

<p>4 <i>That all such goods fruits and possessions as
the King had taken from the Sea of <span class="f">Canterbury</span>,
should bee restored to him at his returne into <span class="f">England</span>.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Thus <i>Anselme</i> returned into <i>England</i>, and
after a short time the king followed; hauing taken
his brother prisoner, and subdued <i>Normandie</i>
to his subiection.</p>

<p>Forthwith <i>Anselme</i> by permission of the K.
assembled a great Councell of the Clergie at
<i>Westminster</i>; wherein hee so wrought with the
King, that at length (albeit not without great
difficultie) it was newly decreed; that no temporal
man should giue inuestiture with Crosse,
or with Ring, or with Pastoral staffe. Also he directed
Iniuncti&#333;s to the Priests of his Prouince,
that they and their wiues should neuer meete
within one house; that they should not keepe
any woman in their house, but such as were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
next in kinred vnto them; That hee who held
his wife and presumed to say Masse within
eight dayes after, should solemnely be excommunicate.
That all Archdeacons and their Officials
should bee sworne, not to winke at the
meetings of Priests and their wiues for any respect,
and if they would not take this oath,
then to lose their office; that such Priests as
would forsake their wiues, should cease fourty
dayes from ministration in their office, and
performe such penance as should be enioyned
them by their Bishop. The execution of these
Canons importing both a great and sudden alteration,
occasioned much disquiet and disorder
in many parts of the Realme.</p>

<p>In the same Councel the censure of Excommunication
was cast vpon those, who did exercise
the vile vice of Sodomitrie: and it was further
decreed, that the same sentence should be
published euery Sonday in al the parish Churches
of <i>England</i>. But afterward it was esteemed
fit; that this general excommunication should
be repealed. The pretence was, for that the
prohibiting, yea, the publike naming of that
vice might enflame the hearts of vngracious
persons with desire vnto it. But wise men con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>iectured,
that after this seuere restreint of marriage
in the Clergie, it did grow so frequent
and familiar among them, that they would not
giue way to so generall a punishment. It is certaine
that in this Kings dayes <i>Io. Cremensis</i> a
Priest Cardinal, by the Kings licence came into
<i>England</i>, and held a solemne Synode at <i>London</i>;
where hauing most sharpely enueighed against
the marriage of Priests, the night following
hee was taken in adulterie, and so with
shame departed the Realme. It is certaine also
that <i>Anselme</i>, the most earnest enforcer of
single life, died not a Virgine; as by the lamentation
which hee wrote for the losse thereof it
may appeare.</p>

<p>Not long after <i>Anselme</i> died, being of the
age of 70. yeeres. He had bestowed much money
on <i>Christs</i> Church in <i>Canterburie</i>; as well in
buildings, as in ornaments, and encrease of
possessions. Other workes of charge he left not
many; neither in very deed could he, by reason
of his often banishments, and the seasures
of the reuenues of his Church. But this he did
more then liberally supply by the eternall labours
of his penne. After his decease the Archbishopricke
remained voyd fiue yeeres: during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
which time, the King applied the fruits to himselfe.
The like hee did to other vacant
Churches; and compounded also with Priests
for reteining their wiues; and made his profit
by Ecclesiasticall persons and liuings, more
largely and freely then he had done before. For
which cause it is not vnlike that the imputation
of couetousnesse was fixed vpon him. At the
last <i>Radulph</i> Bishop of <i>Rochester</i> was aduanced
to the See of <i>Canterburie</i>; and notwithstanding
all former agreements and decrees, the
King inuested him with Ring and with Staffe.</p>

<p>But howsoeuer we may either excuse or extenuate
the two vices of crueltie and couetousnesse,
wherewith he is charged, his immoderate
excesse in lust can no wayes be denied, no
wayes defended: And when age had somewhat
abated in him the heat of that humour,
yet was hee too much pleased with remembrance
of his youthfull follies. For this vice it is
manifest, as well by the sudden and vnfortunate
losse of his children, as for that he was the
last King by descent from males of the <i>Norman</i>
race, that the hand of God pressed hard vpon
him.</p>

<p>As <i>Radulph</i> succeeded <i>Anselme</i> in the See of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
<i>Canterburie</i>. So after the death of <i>Thomas</i>,
<i>Thurstine</i> the Kings Chapplaine was elected
Archb. of <i>Yorke</i>. And because he refused to acknowledge
obedience to the See of <i>Canterbury</i>,
hee could not haue his Consecration, but was
depriued of his dignitie by the King. Hereupon
he tooke his iourney to <i>Rome</i>, complained
to the Pope, and from him returned with a letter
to the King: that the putting of a Bishop
elect from his Church, without iudgement,
was against diuine Iustice, against the decrees
of holy Fathers: that the Pope intended no
preiudice to either Church, but to maintaine
the constitution which S. <i>Gregorie</i>, the Apostle
of the <i>English</i> Nation, had stablished betweene
them: that the Bishop elect should be receiued
to his Church, and if any question did rise between
the two Churches, it should be handled
before the King.</p>

<p>Vpon occasion of this letter a solemne assembly
was called at <i>Salisburie</i>, where the variance
betweene the two Prelats was much debated.
<i>Radulph</i> would not giue Imposition of
hands to <i>Thurstine</i>, vnlesse hee would professe
obedience. <i>Thurstine</i> said, that he would gladly
embrace his benediction, but professe obedi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>ence
to him he would not. The King signified
to <i>Thurstine</i>, that without acknowledgement
of subiection to the Archb. of <i>Canterburie</i>, hee
should not be Consecrated Archb. of <i>Yorke</i>.
<i>Thurstine</i> replied nothing; but renounced his
dignitie, and promised to make no more claime
vnto it.</p>

<p>Not long after, <i>Calixtus</i> Bishop of <i>Rome</i> assembled
a Councell at <i>Rhemes</i>; and <i>Thurstine</i>
desired licence of the King to goe to that
Councell. This hee obtained vnder faithfull
promise, that he should there attempt nothing
to the preiudice of the Church of <i>Canterburie</i>.
In the meane time the King dealt secretly with
the Pope, that <i>Thurstine</i> should not bee consecrated
by him. This the Pope did faithfully
assure; and yet by meanes of some of his Cardinals,
whom <i>Thurstine</i> had wrought to bee
suiters for him; by reason also of his hate against
<i>Radulph</i>, for taking Inuestiture from the King;
The Pope was drawen to giue him consecration,
and therewith the Pall. For this cause the
King was displeased with <i>Thurstine</i>, and forbad
him to returne into the Realme.</p>

<p>After this, the Pope came to <i>Gisors</i>, to which
place the King went vnto him; and desired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
that he would not send any Legates into <i>England</i>,
except the King should so require. The
reason was, for that certaine Legates had come
into <i>England</i> lately before, to wit, one <i>Guido</i>,
and another named <i>Anselme</i>, and another called
<i>Peter</i>; who had demeaned themselues, not
as Pillars of the Church, but as Pillagers of all
the Realme. Also he required that hee might
reteine all such customes, as his auncestors had
vsed in <i>England</i> and in <i>Normandie</i>. The Pope
vpon promise that the King should ayd him against
his enemies, yeelded to these demands:
and required againe of the King, to permit
<i>Thurstine</i> to returne with his fauour into <i>England</i>.
The King excused himselfe by his oath.
The Pope answered, that he might and would
dispence with him for his oath. The King craued
respite, affirming that he would aduise with
his Counsaile, and then signifie to the Pope
what he should resolue. So in short time hee
declared to the Pope, that for loue to him,
<i>Thurstine</i> should bee receiued both into the
Realme and to his Church: vpon condition,
that he should professe subiection to the Sea of
<i>Canterburie</i>, as in former times his predecessors
had done; otherwise (said hee) so long as I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
shall bee King of <i>England</i>, hee shall neuer sit
Archbishop of <i>Yorke</i>.</p>

<p>The yeere following the Pope directed his
letters to the King, and likewise to <i>Radulph</i>.
And herewith he interdicted both the Church
of <i>Canterburie</i> and the Church of <i>Yorke</i>, with all
the Parish Churches of both Prouinces; from
Diuine seruice, from Buriall of the dead, from
all other offices of the Church; except onely
baptizing of children, and absolution of those
who shal lie at the point of death: vnlesse within
one moneth after the receit of the same letters,
<i>Thurstine</i> should be receiued to the Sea of
<i>Yorke</i>, without acknowledging subiection to
the Sea of <i>Canterburie</i>. It was further signified
to the King, that he should also be excommunicate,
vnlesse hee would consent to the same.
Vpon these letters <i>Thurstine</i> was sent for, and
reconciled to the King, and quietly placed in
his Church at <i>Yorke</i>. And thus when the Bishops
of Rome had gained absolute superiority
ouer the state of the Church, euen for managing
external actions and affaires (which seeme
to be a part of ciuill gouernement) there wanted
nothing but either a weake Prince, or a factious
Nobilitie, or a headstrong tumultuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
people, to giue him absolute superioritie ouer
all.</p>

<p>In the second yeere of this Kings reigne the
Cities of <i>Gloucester</i> and <i>Winchester</i> were for the
most part wasted with fire.</p>

<p>In the fourth yeere a blasing starre appeared,
and foure circles were seene about the
Sunne. The yeere next following the King
preuailed much in <i>Normandie</i>, and so did the
Sea in <i>Flanders</i>: insomuch as a great part of that
Countrey lay buried in the waters.</p>

<p>In the seuenth yeere a blazing starre appeared:
and vpon thursday night before Easter,
two full Moones were seene, one in the East,
and the other in the West. The same yeere <i>Robert</i>
Duke of <i>Normandie</i> was taken &amp; brought
prisoner into <i>England</i>.</p>

<p>In the tenth yeere the Abbey of <i>Elie</i> was
made a Bishops Sea, and Cambridge shire was
appointed for the Diocesse thereof. In regard
whereof, the King gaue the mannour of <i>Spalding</i>
to the Bishop of <i>Lincolne</i>, for that the
shire of <i>Cambridge</i> was formerly vnder the Iurisdiction
of <i>Lincolne</i>. The same yeere a Comet
appeared after a strange fashi&#333;. About <i>Shrewsburie</i>
was a great earthquake. The water of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
<i>Trent</i> was dried vp at <i>Nottingham</i> the space of
a mile, from one of the clocke vntill three: so as
men might passe ouer the Channell on foote.
Warres ensued against the Earle of <i>Aniou</i>; a
great mortalitie of men; a murraine of beastes
both domesticke and of the fielde: yea, the
foules perished in great abundance.</p>

<p>In the 13. yeere the Citie of <i>Worcester</i>, and
therein the chiefe Church, the Castle, with
much people were consumed with fire. A pigge
was farrowed with a face like a childe. A chicken
was hatched with foure legs. The yeere
next ensuing the riuer of <i>Medeway</i> so fayled for
many miles, that in the middest of the channell
the smallest boates could not floate. In the
<i>Thames</i> also was such defect of water, that betweene
the Tower and the Bridge many men
and children did wade ouer on foote. This
happened by reason of a great ebbe in the Ocean,
which layd the sands bare many miles
from the shoare, and so continued one whole
day. Much rage and violence of weather ensued,
and a blasing starre. The Citie of <i>Chichester</i>
with the principall Monastery was burnt.
The yeere next following almost all the Bridges
in <i>England</i> being then of timber, by reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
of a hard Winter were borne downe with Ice.</p>

<p>In the 17. yeere the towne of <i>Peterborough</i>
with the stately Church were burned to the
ground. The Citie of <i>Bath</i> also was much ruined
and defaced with fire. In March there happened
fearefull lightning, and in December
grieuous thunder and haile. The Moone at
both times seemed to be turned into blood, by
reason of the euill qualited vapours through
which it gaue light. The yeere following, <i>Mathild</i>
the Queene departed this life: a woman
in pietie, chastitie, modestie, and all other vertues
nothing inferiour to her mother; but in
learning and iudgement farre beyond her:
who did not act, nor speake, nor scarce thinke
any thing, but first it was weighed by wisdome
and vertue. When the king desired her in marriage,
for the publicke good and tranquilitie of
the State, in reducing the <i>Saxon</i> blood to the
Crowne; she first modestly, then earnestly refused
the offer; shewing no lesse magnanimitie
in despising honours, then others doe in affecting
them. But when she was not so much
perswaded as importuned to forsake her profession,
she is reported by some to haue taken
the matter so to heart, that she cursed such issue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
as she should bring forth: which curse did afterwards
lie heauie vpon them. For her sonne
<i>William</i> perished by shipwrack, and her daughter
<i>Matild</i> was neuer voyd of great vexations.
As she trauailed ouer the riuer of <i>Lue</i>, at the
<i>Old-foord</i> neere <i>London</i>, she was well washed,
and somewhat endangered in her passage:
whereupon he caused two Stone-bridges to be
built ouer the same riuer, one at the head of the
towne of <i>Stratford</i>, the other ouer another
streame thereof, commonly called <i>Channels-bridge</i>;
and paued the way betweene them
with grauel. She gaue also certaine mannours,
and a mill called <i>Wiggon</i> mill, for repairing of
the same bridges and way. These were the
first Stone-bridges that were made in <i>England</i>.
And because they were arched like a bow, the
towne of <i>Stratford</i> was afterwards called <i>Bow</i>.</p>

<p>In the 20. yere, a great earthquake hapned,
in the moneth of September. In the 22. yeere,
the Citie of <i>Glocester</i>, with the principal Monasterie
was fired againe. The yeere next following,
the Citie of <i>Lincolne</i> was for the most part
burned downe, and many persons perished
with the rage of the flame. In the 27. yeere,
the King receiued an oath of the chiefe of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
Prelats and Nobilitie of the Realme; that after
his death, they should maintaine the kingdom
against al men for his daughter <i>Matild</i>, in case
she should suruiue, and the king not leaue issue
male in life.</p>

<p>In the 30. yeere, the Citie of <i>Rochester</i> was
much defaced with fire, euen in the presence
and view of the King. The yeere next following
the oath to <i>Matild</i> was receiued againe.
About this time the King was much troubled
with fearefull dreames; which did so affright
him, that he would often leape out of his bed,
and lay hand on his sword, as if it were to defend
himselfe. This yeere as he returned out of
<i>Normandie</i> into <i>England</i>, when he had bene
caried not farre from land, the winde began to
rise, and the Sea swelled somewhat bigge. This
weather did almost suddenly encrease to so
dangerous a storme, that all expected to be cast
away. The King, dismayed the more by his
sonnes mishap, reconciled himselfe to God; and
vowed to reforme many errours of his life, if he
did escape. So after his arriuall, he went to the
Monasterie of S. <i>Edmund</i>; and there both ratified
and renued the promise he had made. After
this he was better ordered in his actions; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
erected a Bishopricke at <i>Caerlile</i>, and endowed
it with many honours: he caused Iustice indifferently
to be administred; and eased the people
of the tribute called <i>Dane guilt</i>.</p>

<p>In the 32. yeere, <i>Matilde</i> daughter to the
King was deliuered of a sonne, who was named
<i>Henry</i>. Hereupon the king assembled his Nobilitie
at <i>Oxeford</i>, where he did celebrate his
feast of Easter; and there ordeined, that shee
and her heires should succeed him in the kingdome.
And albeit they were often sworne to
this appointment; albeit <i>Stephen</i> Earle of <i>Bloise</i>
was the first man who tooke that oath: yet was
he the first who did rise against it; yet did many
others also ioyne with him in his action. For
oathes are commonly troden vnder foote,
when they lye in the way, either to honour or
reuenge. The same yeere the Citie of <i>London</i>
was very much defaced with fire.</p>

<p>The yeere next following, many prodigies
happened, which seemed to portend the death
of the King, or rather the troublesome times
which did thereupon ensue. In the moneth of
August, the Sunne was so deepely eclipsed,
that by reason of the darkenesse of the ayre,
many starres did plainely appeare. The second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
day after this defect of light, the earth trembled
with so great violence, that many buildings
were shaken downe. <i>Malmesb.</i> sayth,
that the house wherein he sate, was lift vp with
a double remooue, and at the third time setled
againe in the proper place. The earth in diuers
places yeelded foorth a hideous noyse; It cast
foorth flames at certaine rifts diuers dayes together,
which neither by water nor by any other
meanes could be suppressed.</p>

<p>During the time of the eclipse mentioned
before, the King was trauersing the sea into
<i>Normandie</i>; whither hee vsually went, sometimes
euery yeere, but euery third yeere at the
furthest. Here he spent the whole yeere following,
in ordering affaires of State, and in
visiting euery corner of the Countrey. He neuer
gaue greater contentment to the people, as
well by his gifts, as by his gentle and courteous
behauiour: he neuer receiued greater contentment
from them, by the liuely expressing of
their loue. But nothing did so much affect
him with ioy, as that his daughter <i>Matild</i> had
brought foorth other two sonnes, <i>Geoffrey</i>
and <i>William</i>: whereby hee conceiued, that the
succession of his issue to the Crowne of <i>England</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
was so well backed, that he needed not to trouble
his thoughts with any feare that his heires
would faile.</p>

<p>At the last he began to languish a little and
droupe in health; and neither feeling nor fearing
any great cause, hee rode on hunting, to
passe it ouer with exercise and delight. Herewith
being somewhat cheered, hee returned
home, and eate of a Lamprey, albeit against
his Physicians aduise, which meate he alwayes
loued, but was neuer able well to digest. After
this, and happely vpon this vicious feeding,
he fell into a feuer; which increased in him by
such dangerous degrees, that within seuen
dayes it led him to the period of his life. Hee
died vpon the first of December, in the 67. yere
of his age: when hee had reigned 35. yeeres
and foure moneths, wanting one day. His
bowels and eyes were buried at <i>Roan</i>: The
rest of his bodie was stuffed with salt, wrapped
vp in Oxe hides, and brought ouer into <i>England</i>;
and with honourable exequies buried in
the Monastery of <i>Reading</i>, which hee had
founded. His Physician who tooke out his
braines, by reason of the intolerable stinch
which breathed from them, in short time after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
ended his life. So of all that King <i>Henrie</i> slue,
this Physician was the last.</p>

<p>He had by his first wife a sonne named <i>William</i>,
who perished by shipwracke; and <i>Matild</i>
a daughter, who was espoused to the Emperour
<i>Henrie</i> the 5. when she was scarce sixe
yeeres olde, and at the age of eleuen yeeres
was married vnto him. When shee had been
married vnto him twelue yeeres, he died; and
shee returned to the King her father, both against
her owne minde, and against the desire
of the greatest Princes of the Empire: who in
regard of her wise and gracious behauiour,
were suitors to the King more then once, to
haue her remaine as Empresse among them.
But the king would not consent to their intreatie:
For that shee was the onely heire to his
Crowne. Then many great Princes desired her
in marriage. But the King bestowed her vpon
<i>Geoffrey</i>, sonne to <i>Fulke</i> Earle of <i>Aniou</i>:
somewhat against her owne liking, but greatly
to the suretie of his estate in <i>France</i>. By him
she had <i>Henrie</i>, who afterwards was King of
<i>England</i>.</p>

<p>Further, the King had by a Concubine, <i>Richard</i>
a sonne, and <i>Mary</i> a daughter; who were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
lost vpon the sea with their brother <i>William</i>.
By another Concubine hee had a sonne named
<i>Robert</i>, whom he created Earle of <i>Glocester</i>:
a man for valour of minde and abilitie
of bodie inferiour to none; in counsailes
so aduised, as was fit for a right Noble commander.
By his faith, industrie, and felicitie
chiefly, his sister <i>Matild</i> did afterwards resist
and ouerbeare, both the forces and fortunes of
King <i>Stephen</i>. He is reported to haue had 12.
other bastards; which were of no great either
note or continuance, according to that saying
of the Wise man: <i>Bastard plants take no deepe
rootes</i>.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>This King in the beginning of his Reigne
made many fauourable lawes: And namely,
<i>That he would reserue no possessions of the Church
vpon their vacancies: that the heires of his Nobilitie
should possesse their fathers lands without
redemption from him, and that the Nobilitie likewise
should afford the like fauour to their Tenants:
that Gentlemen might giue their daughters and
kinsewomen in marriage without his licence, so it
were not to his enemie: that the widow should haue
her ioynture, and not be compelled to marrie against
her owne liking: that the mother or next of kinred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
should bee Guardian of the lands of her children:
that all debts to the Crowne and certaine offences
also should bee remitted</i>. But these lawes afterwards
were but slenderly obserued.</p>

<p>Three vertues were most famous in him;
wisedome, courage, and sweetenesse of speach.
By the last hee gained much fauour from the
people. By the other two he purchased, both
peace at home, and victory abroad. He was
noted also for some vices: but out of doubt
they were farre exceeded by his vertues. And
for these vices also, being himselfe of a pleasant
disposition, he was well pleased with pleasant
reproofes. <i>Guymund</i> his Chapleine (obseruing
that vnworthy men for the most part
were aduanced to the best dignities of the
Church) as he celebrated Diuine seruice before
him, and was to read these words out of
S. <i>Iames</i>; [<i>It rained not vpon the earth iij. yeres and
vj. moneths</i>:]<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> Hee did read it thus: [<i>It rained
not vpon the earth one, one, one yeres, and fiue, one,
moneths</i>.] The King obserued this reading, and
afterwards rebuked his Chapleine for it: But
<i>Guymund</i> answered, that he did it of purpose, for
that such readers were soonest preferred by the
King. The King smiled, and in short time after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
preferred him to the gouernment of S. <i>Frideswides</i>
in <i>Oxeford</i>. In this King failed the heires
male of King <i>William</i> the first: and then the
Crowne was possessed by Title of heires generall.</p>

<p class="center">In these times flourished two excellent ornaments
of the Church; <i>Anselme</i> in <i>England</i>, and
<i>Bernard</i> in <i>France</i>: both of them enrolled in
the list of Saints. And no lesse infamous for
vice was <i>Gerard</i>, Archbishop of <i>Yorke</i>; a man of
some learning; not so much in substance, as in
seeming and shew; of commendable wit, which
he applied chiefly, to giue a couler for euery
vice of his owne, and for euery vertue of others
either a slander or a ieast: Of enuious disposition;
plagued lesse with his owne calamities,
then with the well either doing or being of other
men; in wiping money from his Subiects
by dishonest meanes, subtill and shamelesse;
and no lesse sordide in his expences: giuen to
Magicall enchantments as many doe affirme.
On a certaine day as he slept vpon a cushion
after dinner, in his Garden at <i>Southwell</i>, and
many of his Chapleines walked neere him; he
was found in such a stiffe cold dead sleepe, as
will require the trumpe of an Archangel to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>wake
him. His face then looked with an ougly
hell-burnt hue. His body was caried to <i>Yorke</i>;
few vouchsafing to accompany,<br />
none to meete it (according to the vse of Exequies) when it came to the Citie;<br />
but the boyes in scorne throwing stones at the hearse. He was<br />
basely buried without the Church without any<br />
funerall solemnities, without any<br />
signe either of honour<br />
or of griefe.<br />

<p>Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

<p>Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.</p>

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/license">http://www.gutenberg.org/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
